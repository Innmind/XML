I called our culture writer Shirley Li for her tips on the movies and the buzz you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, here are three new stories from &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/congressman-george-santos-lies-danger/672785/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The George Santos saga isn’t (just) funny.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/biden-economic-priorities-non-college-educated-voters-industrialize-america/672764/?utm_source=feed"&gt;How Joe Biden wins again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/chatgpt-ai-economy-automation-jobs/672767/?utm_source=feed"&gt;How ChatGPT will destabilize white-collar work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Guns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel Fattal:&lt;/b&gt; Are there any big themes that have emerged from this awards season, or any lessons about the state of Hollywood today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shirley Li:&lt;/b&gt; If there’s one way to summarize this awards season, it would be that it’s been a year of comebacks. When you look at the leading contenders in the performance categories, we have a lot of actors who are returning to the awards conversation after a long career of not being involved in such conversations. The names that come to mind include Brendan Fraser, Michelle Yeoh, and Ke Huy Quan. All of those are actors who got shuffled out of Hollywood for one reason or another, but have been given these opportunities to return to acting or to finally sink their teeth into meaty roles, and are now deservedly getting their flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d also say it’s been a year of comebacks when it comes to major sequels. Films like &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/05/top-gun-maverick-review-tom-cruise/643112/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/12/avatar-2-way-of-water-movie-review-james-cameron/672448/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Avatar: The Way of Water&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;being a part of the awards conversation signifies that there’s room for sequels to succeed beyond the box office, and that superhero films aren’t the only ones bringing audiences back to theaters, which have been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/01/movie-theaters-streaming-film-industry-the-fabelmans/672766/?utm_source=feed"&gt;struggling&lt;/a&gt; since the pandemic. &lt;i&gt;Top Gun &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;made strong cases for seeing movies on the biggest screens possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel:&lt;/b&gt; What is the importance, if any, of movie awards now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shirley:&lt;/b&gt; If done right—and this is hard to do—awards-show speeches can be a great opportunity to tell a story that’s not just, “I love my agents; I love my managers.” I think about [&lt;i&gt;Everything Everywhere All at Once&lt;/i&gt; actor] Ke Huy Quan’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/01/golden-globes-return-speeches/672700/?utm_source=feed"&gt;speech at the Golden Globes&lt;/a&gt;, where he talks about that feeling of self-doubt, of wondering whether his work as a child actor is all he had to offer, not just in his career but in his life. If more winners think about the story they can tell, that’s a way to reach people beyond the room, to be accessible to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel:&lt;/b&gt; What are the two or three movies you need to watch if you want to keep up with the awards chatter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shirley:&lt;/b&gt; The first is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/03/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-movie-review/629357/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everything Everywhere All at Once&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I think that film has a lot of momentum when it comes to this awards season, but on a broader scale, it’s such a fascinating example of how wild this medium can be. It’s almost impossible to classify when it comes to a genre. It comes from a pair of directors who have a really unique creative vision; they’re the ones who made the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/swiss-army-man-is-a-fart-filled-wonder/489818/?utm_source=feed"&gt;farting-corpse movie&lt;/a&gt; with Daniel Radcliffe. When you watch it, you don’t think of it as an Oscar contender, but it’s proof that a genre movie can make it really far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second movie is the more traditional contender in the mix: &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/11/steven-spielberg-the-fabelmans-movie-review/672078/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fabelmans&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/12/steven-spielberg-the-fabelmans-blockbuster-legacy/672456/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt;–directed film that is plumbing his own childhood. It’s in some ways about why he became a director, but at the same time, it’s about how he wrestled with his parents’ divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third movie I recommend watching, which is now available on HBO Max, is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/banshees-of-inisherin-2022-movie-review/671801/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Banshees of Inisherin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the film that reunites the writer-director &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/filmmaker-martin-mcdonagh-career-banshees-of-inisherin/671825/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Martin McDonagh&lt;/a&gt; with Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell. It’s this more intimate number about friendship and toxic masculinity and being a part of a small community. When it comes to awards season, I think it’s somewhere in between the other two films I recommended. It’s made by a previous Oscar winner, while at the same time being unconventional in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel:&lt;/b&gt; I have a question about another awards contender,&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/tar-movie-review-cate-blanchett/671665/?utm_source=feed"&gt; &lt;i&gt;Tár&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It has become something of a meme to pretend that Lydia Tár, the main character, is a real person. Why do you think this is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shirley:&lt;/b&gt; I was just talking about this with a friend who was asking the same thing, because on the surface, &lt;i&gt;Lydia Tár is a real person&lt;/i&gt; is not a funny joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as a meme format, it doesn’t really make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think what set it off was Cate Blanchett’s performance. It’s so convincing. Lydia Tár is this EGOT-winning conductor. But as you watch the film, you kind of realize that “Lydia Tár” is a costume that this woman is wearing. And as the film goes on, it becomes both a horror and a comedy, and it goes into camp territory. It’s all grounded in this performance that is so sharp and that makes you almost believe that Lydia Tár is a real person. But to be honest, maybe the meme just comes from how funny “Lydia Tár” sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel:&lt;/b&gt; Have you had any arguments with fellow movie people about the awards contenders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shirley:&lt;/b&gt; One recent debate I had with a critic was over whether &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/12/babylon-movie-review-damien-chazelle/672560/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Babylon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is any good and deserving of all this awards attention, or if it’s just so audaciously stupid that it tricks you into not being able to fully hate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Babylon&lt;/i&gt; didn’t do very well at the box office, so I doubt a lot of folks have seen it. It’s a film starring an A-list cast, including Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt, that’s about Hollywood’s transition from making silent pictures to making talkies. This is like catnip for awards committees—a big, maximalist Hollywood movie from Damien Chazelle, the director of&lt;i&gt; La La Land&lt;/i&gt;, about Hollywood itself. But it’s also lewd and vulgar and three hours long. It spans decades. It is self-indulgent. It follows way too many characters. It opens with a scene in which an elephant poops onto the camera. Maybe that last bit’s all you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel:&lt;/b&gt; Is there a movie or performance that you think is being overlooked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shirley:&lt;/b&gt; So many, but I’ll try to stick to just a few. The first one is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/01/women-talking-movie-review/672662/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Women Talking&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the film directed and adapted by Sarah Polley from the 2018 novel of the same name. It’s a really tough sell, because the story is based on &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4w7gqj/the-ghost-rapes-of-bolivia-000300-v20n8"&gt;a series of real-life rapes&lt;/a&gt; that happened in a Mennonite community in Bolivia. It’s about one long conversation the women in this community have where they try to imagine what they can do next. But it’s more engaging than you might think. I worry that it’s coming so late in this awards season that people have just not been interested in seeing it or have not been able to see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another contender that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/aftersun-review-charlotte-wells-interview/671933/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aftersun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from the writer and director Charlotte Wells, which is a film about a father-daughter relationship and how we struggle to understand our parents. I think the performances in that are outstanding, and Wells is an immensely talented filmmaker, but I’m afraid the categories are too crowded at this point for them to make it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Happens When AI Has Read Everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ross Andersen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence has in recent years proved itself to be a quick study, although it is being educated in a manner that would shame the most brutal headmaster. Locked into airtight Borgesian libraries for months with no bathroom breaks or sleep, AIs are told not to emerge until they’ve finished a self-paced speed course in human culture. On the syllabus: a decent fraction of all the surviving text that we have ever produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When AIs surface from these epic study sessions, they possess astonishing new abilities. People with the most linguistically supple minds—hyperpolyglots—can reliably flip back and forth between a dozen languages; AIs can now translate between more than 100 in real time. They can churn out pastiche in a range of literary styles and write passable rhyming poetry. DeepMind’s Ithaca AI can glance at Greek letters etched into marble and guess the text that was chiseled off by vandals thousands of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read the full article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More From &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/09/the-woman-king-prince-bythewood-movie-review/671440/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Woman King&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a crowd-pleasing, great action film, and Viola Davis’s performance is a departure from what she’s done before.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“There’s a South Korean film called &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/decision-to-leave-movie-review-park-chan-wook/671739/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Decision to Leave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that I wrote about. It’s a fantastic erotic thriller that I’m afraid will only be recognized in international categories, even though the direction is so sumptuous. I could not take my eyes off the screen. Every frame has new clues to the story.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Lastly, there’s a tiny movie called &lt;i&gt;Emily the Criminal&lt;/i&gt; that I think is mostly getting indie-awards attention. It stars Aubrey Plaza, and it’s such a sharp little movie about credit-card fraud, of all things, but that’s what makes it great and insightful about wealth and income inequality.”&lt;/li&gt;

Velma (played by the show’s executive producer, Mindy Kaling) and Daphne (Constance Wu) sell drugs. Fred (Glenn Howerton) gets shot in both legs. Shaggy (Sam Richardson), known by his birth name, Norville, tries to sell a kidney on the black market. Scenes of gratuitous violence pad almost every episode: Limbs get severed, corpses roll out of trash bins, riots break out in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meddling kids getting into wacky mysteries with their dog, this show is adamantly not. And in the months leading up to &lt;i&gt;Velma&lt;/i&gt;’s debut, the creative team seemed to anticipate backlash to the bold changes they’d made. The creator, Charlie Grandy, &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/velma-mindy-kaling-cast-show-backlash-scooby-absence-explained-nycc-2022-10"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the writers’ alterations—including excising Scooby from the gang, reimagining Velma as a misanthropic South Asian teenager, and incorporating grotesque gags—felt authentic to the spirit of the original series. “We wanted to be respectful,” he explained. “We didn’t want to just kind of take these beloved characters and put them in outrageous or gross situations and say, ‘Isn’t it crazy you did that to Velma?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only viewers felt the same way. Since &lt;i&gt;Velma&lt;/i&gt; began airing on HBO Max this month, audiences have pummeled the series with negative reviews. Many complaints are—as is frequently the case with projects that change the ethnicity of originally white characters—knee-jerk, racist reactions to seeing well-known figures in a new context. Other viewers say that the show is too vulgar, transforming Velma and the gang into characters they no longer recognize. But the real problem with &lt;i&gt;Velma &lt;/i&gt;isn’t that its updates make &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/03/euphoria-hbo-season-2-review/624173/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Euphoria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;look like child’s play; it’s that its edginess comes at the expense of its own characters and punishes the audience for being invested. Like a certain Mystery Inc. member rummaging around in the dark for her glasses, the series is unfocused, confused, and desperately lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/01/comfort-tv-show-recommendations-the-fosters-julia/672641/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: 13 feel-good shows to watch this winter&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issues begin with &lt;i&gt;Velma&lt;/i&gt;’s overreliance on meta jokes about television in place of a compelling plot. The show follows Velma as she attempts to find the serial killer targeting high-school girls, searches for her missing mother, and tries to overcome nightmarish hallucinations that occur when she pursues cases—storytelling beats meant to parody dark teen dramas such as &lt;i&gt;Riverdale&lt;/i&gt;. That concept, though, quickly grows old. Characters constantly pause the action to call out and summarize narrative tropes rather than letting the story unfold. In an upcoming episode, for instance, Velma explains her relationship with her father in terms of television history before the scene plays out. “If there’s one thing teen dramas get right, it’s that nothing is ever actually a teenager’s fault,” she says. “We’re all really just paying for the sins of our parents. They’re either lying to us, or trying to change us, or hiding some dark family secret. But when it comes to truly crappy parents, no one beats my dad.” The monologue is unfunny, unsubtle, and completely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, such moments reduce the ensemble into static joke-delivery machines. Kaling and the rest of the cast deliver enthusiastic performances, but their animated counterparts never come across as actual teenagers or coherent characters. They tease each other by pointing out the stereotypes they embody, flattening everyone into the very archetypes they’re skewering: Daphne is a hot girl obsessed with being popular, Fred is a womanizing rich kid with daddy issues, Norville is a loser who can’t get laid, and Velma is a hypercritical outcast. When characters do grow, the evolution is inconsistent or simply played for laughs. Velma, in one episode, realizes she has “no clue how to be a woman in a way that doesn’t judge other women,” but by the next installment, she’s once again pettily tearing down a female classmate. Fred reads &lt;i&gt;The Feminine Mystique&lt;/i&gt;, only for his attraction to “inner beauty” to become a running gag. The show, as a result, doesn’t feel clever; it just feels mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;i&gt;Velma &lt;/i&gt;isn’t really reimagining Velma—or Daphne, or Fred, or Norville—at all. Through endless references and half-hearted attempts at self-aware humor, the show seems most concerned with picking apart the original franchise: the ludicrousness of the mysteries, the absurdity of the gang’s efforts, the tropes each character perpetuated. Yet in doing so, the series fails to make fresh observations about &lt;i&gt;Scooby-Doo&lt;/i&gt; or about the teen-drama genre. It just offers a relentless barrage of outdated pop-culture commentary. Across the eight episodes I’ve seen, the weak jokes come first. Take a scene of Velma and her father heading to a strip club for lunch, for example. The setup could have been an opportunity to examine the characters’ awkward relationship, but it’s mostly done for shock value—as well as to land a tasteless punch line about how strippers take off their clothes because they’re still chasing their father’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mature updates of venerated cartoons can work. HBO Max itself houses one of the best: &lt;i&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/i&gt;, a colorful extension of the DC animated universe that follows the titular comic-book character striking out on her own. Like &lt;i&gt;Velma&lt;/i&gt;, the show is violent, packed with meta jokes, and concerned with depicting a female character’s journey of self-discovery. But unlike &lt;i&gt;Velma&lt;/i&gt;, the series has a clear reverence for the original franchise; it treats Harley with respect, prioritizing her development even amid rapid-fire jokes. &lt;i&gt;Velma&lt;/i&gt;, meanwhile, emphasizes its shallow humor, yielding a project that struggles to be playful and misunderstands its protagonist’s appeal. No, reboots shouldn’t be carbon copies of their source material. But neither should they dismiss it—or sneer at the viewers who care.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shirley Li</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/shirley-li/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OPbgHBVaY4GScWmJnaYEDc0pMHU=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/velma_hr/original.jpg"><media:credit>HBO Max</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Line That &lt;em&gt;Velma&lt;/em&gt; Crossed</title><published>2023-01-20T15:30:26-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T15:30:27-05:00</updated><summary type="html">The show’s real problem is its attitude toward viewers.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/01/hbo-max-velma-review-mindy-kaling-backlash/672796/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672793</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Noora Alsaeed has often thought about building a snowman on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let’s go over that again. A snowman on &lt;em&gt;Mars&lt;/em&gt;? That desertlike, desolate planet over there? The one covered in sand? What an unusual daydream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But Alsaeed knows a few things that the rest of us don’t. She is a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder whose work relies on data from a NASA spacecraft that orbits Mars. She studies the red planet’s polar regions and the peculiar molecules suspended in the atmosphere above them. She knows that on Mars, it snows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Just like Earth, Mars &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/spring-winter-earth-planets/585310/?utm_source=feed"&gt;has seasons&lt;/a&gt;, and during the winter—about twice as long as ours—icy crystals cascade from the clouds and accumulate on the frigid surface. This sounds unbelievable, given that Mars is notoriously dry. But Mars gets around that little technicality by substituting intricate, six-sided water snow for something else. The Martian atmosphere, many times thinner than Earth’s, is primarily composed of carbon dioxide. In the most bitter conditions, the carbon dioxide transforms from a gas into small, cube-shaped crystals of ice—specifically dry ice, the kind we earthlings use to set a spooky scene on Halloween. The ice is too heavy to remain in the Martian sky, so it flurries down, settling in shallow piles on the red planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mars is the planet that, aside from Earth, has likely made the largest impression on the public imagination. We’re well acquainted with Mars as the planet with &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/12/perseverance-captures-mars-dust-devil-sound/672495/?utm_source=feed"&gt;all the rovers&lt;/a&gt;, the place where Elon Musk wants people to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/elon-musk-spacex-starship-launch/618781/?utm_source=feed"&gt;make a second home&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/10/mars-pandemic-future-nasa-spacex/616566/?utm_source=feed"&gt;obvious next destination&lt;/a&gt; now that humans have been to the moon. But under all that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/08/mars-solar-system-exploration/615163/?utm_source=feed"&gt;hype&lt;/a&gt; are subtler, downright fascinating details about the fourth planet from the sun, such as its &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/nasa-perseverance-mars-sounds/629706/?utm_source=feed"&gt;mesmerizing soundscape&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/07/mars-perseverance-rover-camera-pictures/661489/?utm_source=feed"&gt;richly textured rock formations&lt;/a&gt;, layered like mille-feuille. Carbon-dioxide snow is just one of Mars’s many curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/nasa-perseverance-mars-sounds/629706/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Mars’s soundscape is strangely beautiful&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Scientists began to suspect that Mars’s polar regions could become cold enough to turn carbon dioxide into snow as early as the 1800s, Paul Hayne, a planetary scientist at CU Boulder who studies Martian snowfall, told me. A NASA mission in the 1970s made observations that would later be interpreted as the first signs of carbon-dioxide snowfall. In 2008, a spacecraft that landed in Mars’s northern plains detected evidence of snow—the water-ice kind!—falling from the atmosphere. But there was no evidence that the water snow actually reached the ground; the air on Mars is so thin that the water sublimates into a gas before the crystals can touch the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling Mars for more than 15 years, has &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/17583-mars-snow-carbon-dioxide-discovery.html"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; carbon-dioxide snow reaching the surface, though. (Scientists don’t have photographic or video evidence of carbon-dioxide snowfall, only detections made with laser technology and observations in wavelengths that are invisible to our eyes. “Since most of the snow on Mars falls in the darkness of polar night, we need to use wavelengths of radiation outside of the visible spectrum,” Hayne said.) The snow even accumulates, mostly near sloped areas such as cliff sides and crater edges, Sylvain Piqueux, a research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who studies Mars, told me. He said that enough of it piles up to—hypothetically—snowshoe in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That idea tickles the imagination. What might it be like to stand on the Martian surface in the middle of winter, the temperatures finally cold enough to loose some molecules from the sky? Snowfall occurs only during the cold Martian night, so if you brought some night-vision goggles, you’d see that you were enveloped in a bright haze. Carbon-dioxide snowflakes are tiny, smaller than the width of a strand of hair—much smaller than their six-sided, water-ice counterparts. “It wouldn’t look as magical as it does on Earth,” Alsaeed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But a Martian blizzard would be lovely in its own way. “It would be extraordinarily quiet,” Hayne said. You might even be able to catch the sound of little carbon-dioxide snow-cubes falling onto the ground. A gust of wind could kick up “an opaque column of glittering snow,” he said. “Glittering” and “snow”—two words that may reshape your mental picture of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/07/mars-perseverance-rover-camera-pictures/661489/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: We’ve never seen Mars quite like this&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So if astronauts could, in theory, snowshoe on the red planet, what else could they do? Skiing is likely out, Hayne said. “Part of what makes skiing possible on Earth is that a thin film of liquid water forms on the surfaces of the ice particles as your ski creates friction, lubricating your motion,” he said. On Mars, that friction would cause icy particles to turn into vapor and billow away, which “would probably make your skis a bit squirrelly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The experts don’t really know whether other classic winter activities could take place on Mars. “The idea of dealing with snow that’s made of CO2 is just so alien to me,” Alsaeed said. “It’s gonna be a completely different ball game.” Piqueux isn’t sure whether carbon-dioxide snow would clump enough to form a snowball, let alone a snowman; dry ice is not exactly a chemical enigma, but how the stuff behaves under Martian conditions is more mysterious, he said. At the very least, you might manage a snow angel. And as for opening your mouth wide to catch a cube-shaped snowflake? “You can’t stick your tongue out on Mars, ever!” Hayne said. (Sorry, I had to ask!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There is much to learn. “Snow might be a universal process for [worlds] with an atmosphere,” Piqueux said. “Learning how it works might tell us quite a bit about planets—what shapes their surface, how they evolve, and what they look like.” Scientists theorize that Mars was more like Earth a few billion years ago—warm and balmy, with real lakes and seas. Perhaps it snowed more back then too, with chunky flakes of frozen water, and the influence of that ancient precipitation remains embedded at the planet’s poles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many decades ago, well before any space robots arrived on Mars, scientists imagined the red planet to be a bustling place, believing that the surface markings they saw through their telescopes were evidence of intelligent engineering. The astronomer Percival Lowell &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1895/05/mars-part-i/305483/?utm_source=feed"&gt;wrote at length&lt;/a&gt; about these markings, which he called canals, in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;in 1895, sparking in the public imagination the tantalizing promise of an inhabited Mars. That ended up not being the case: Any life that may have arisen on Mars is either long dead or hiding out of view, buried away from the glare of the sun. The dissimilarity to Earth was almost disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1895/05/mars-part-i/305483/?utm_source=feed"&gt;From the May 1895 issue: Mars&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But still, there are familiar echoes, as Lowell himself recognized. “If astronomy teaches anything, it teaches that man is but a detail in the evolution of the universe, and that resemblant though diverse details are inevitably to be expected in the host of orbs around him,” he &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1895/08/mars-part-iv/309151/?utm_source=feed"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “He learns that though he will probably never find his double anywhere, he is destined to discover any number of cousins scattered through space.” Cousins like Martian snow—perhaps not enough to make a genuine snowman, but certainly enough to stir our imagination from millions of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marina Koren</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/marina-koren/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/roR8xgBOl8bUh8ot846uf_ce81I=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/snow_on_mars_1/original.jpg"><media:description>An orbiting spacecraft's view of frost, made of carbon dioxide and water, on the surface of Mars</media:description></media:content><title type="html">There’s Snow on Mars</title><published>2023-01-20T14:22:12-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T16:49:11-05:00</updated><summary type="html">And it would be strangely beautiful to behold.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/01/mars-snow-evidence/672793/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672788</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The next front is rapidly emerging in the struggle between supporters and opponents of legal abortion, and that escalating conflict is increasing the chances that the issue will shape the 2024 election as it did last November’s midterm contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden triggered the new confrontation with a flurry of recent moves to expand access to the drugs used in medication abortions, which now account for more than half of all abortions performed in the United States. Medication abortion involves two drugs: mifepristone followed by misoprostol (which is also used to prevent stomach ulcers). Although abortion opponents question the drugs’ safety, multiple scientific studies have found few serious adverse effects beyond headache or cramping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal regulation of the use and distribution of these drugs by agencies including the FDA and the United States Postal Service has long been overshadowed in the abortion debate by the battles over Supreme Court nominations and federal legislation to ban or authorize abortion nationwide. But with a conservative majority now entrenched in the Court, and little chance that Congress will pass national legislation in either direction any time soon, abortion supporters and opponents are focusing more attention on executive-branch actions that influence the availability of the pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/plan-c-secret-option-mail-order-abortion/620324/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The abortion backup plan no one is talking about&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reality of abortion care has been changing very, very rapidly, and now the politics are catching up with it,” Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who served as one of Biden’s advisers in 2020, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists will descend on Washington today for their annual March for Life—the first since the Supreme Court last summer overturned &lt;i&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/i&gt;, the 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. The activists will cheer the swift moves by some two dozen Republican-controlled states to ban or severely restrict abortion since the Court struck down &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as abortion opponents celebrate, they are growing more frustrated about the increased reliance on the drugs, which are now used in 54 percent of U.S. abortions—up dramatically from less than one-third less than a decade ago, &lt;a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions"&gt;according to the Guttmacher Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a research group that supports abortion rights. “With the overturning of &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt;, [with] COVID, and with President Biden’s loosening of the restrictions on these [drugs] … there is a new frontier that everyone is pivoting to,” Rebecca Parma, the legislative director for Texas Right to Life, a prominent anti-abortion group, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George W. Bush and Donald Trump, the two Republicans who have held the presidency since the drugs were first approved under Democratic President Bill Clinton, in 2000, took virtually no steps to limit their availability. But conservative activists are already signaling that they will press the Republican presidential candidates in 2024 for more forceful action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our job is to make sure … this becomes an issue that any GOP candidate will have to answer and address,” Kristan Hawkins, the president of the anti-abortion group Students for Life of America, told me. “No one can be ambivalent again; it will simply not be an option.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Republicans is that the 2022 midterm elections sent an unmistakable signal of resistance to further abortion restrictions in almost all of the key swing states that tipped the 2020 presidential election and are likely to decide the 2024 contest. “Would you really want to be Ron DeSantis or Donald Trump running in a close election saying, ‘I’m going to ban all abortion pills in Michigan or Pennsylvania’ right now?” says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at UC Davis, who has &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/mary-ziegler/?utm_source=feed"&gt;written extensively&lt;/a&gt; on the history of the abortion debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday is the 50th anniversary of the original &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt; decision, and the Biden administration will mark the occasion with a defiant pro-abortion-rights speech from Vice President Kamala Harris in Florida, where GOP Governor DeSantis, a likely 2024 presidential contender, signed a 15-week abortion ban last April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House officials see access to abortion medication as “the next battlefront” in the larger struggle over the procedure, Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council, told me. She said she expects Republicans to mount more sweeping efforts to restrict access to the drugs than they did during the Bush or Trump presidencies. “The reason you’ve seen both Democratic and Republican administrations ensure access to medication abortions is because this is the FDA following their evidence-based scientific judgment,” she said. “So what I think is different now is you are seeing some pretty extreme actions as the next way to double down on taking away reproductive health and reproductive rights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal regulation of the abortion drugs has followed a consistent pattern, with Democratic presidents moving to expand access and Republican presidents mostly accepting those actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/abortion-pill-misoprostol-effectiveness/671465/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The other abortion pill&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/28/abortion.politics/index.html"&gt;During the 2000 presidential campaign&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, George W. Bush &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/28/abortion.politics/index.html"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the Clinton administration’s initial approval of mifepristone “wrong” and said he worried it would lead to more abortions. But over Bush’s two terms, his three FDA commissioners ignored a citizen petition from conservative groups to revoke approval for the drug. Under Barack Obama, the FDA formalized relatively onerous rules for the use of mifepristone. Physicians had to obtain a special certification to prescribe the drug, women had to meet with their doctor once before receiving it and twice after, and it could be used only within the first seven weeks of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/health/abortion-pill-mifeprex-ru-486-fda.html"&gt;he FDA loosened these restrictions&lt;/a&gt; during Obama’s final year in office. It reduced the number of physician visits required to obtain the drugs from three to one and increased to 10 the number of weeks into a pregnancy the drugs could be used. The revisions also permitted other medical professionals, such as nurses, to prescribe the drugs if they received certification, and eliminated a requirement for providers to report “adverse effects” other than death. Trump didn’t reverse any of the Obama decisions. He did side with conservatives by fighting a lawsuit from abortion-rights advocates to lift the requirement for an in-person doctor’s visit to obtain the drugs during the COVID pandemic. But by the time the Supreme Court ruled for the Trump administration in January 2021, Biden was days away from taking office. Within months, women seeking an abortion could consult with a doctor via telehealth and then receive the pills via mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 3 of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/information-about-mifepristone-medical-termination-pregnancy-through-ten-weeks-gestation"&gt;the FDA took another major step by allowing pharmacies&lt;/a&gt; to dispense the drugs. In late December, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/file/1560596/download"&gt;the Justice Department issued a legal opinion&lt;/a&gt; that the Postal Service could deliver the drugs without violating the 19th-century Comstock Act, which bars use of the mail “to corrupt the public morals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paradox is that the impact of these rules, for now, will be felt almost entirely in the states where abortion remains legal. Obtaining abortion pills there will be much more comparable to filling any other prescription. &lt;a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions"&gt;But 19 red states have passed laws&lt;/a&gt; that still require medical professionals to be present when the drugs are administered, which prevents pharmacies from offering them despite the FDA authorization. And although the FDA has approved use of mifepristone for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, medical professionals cannot prescribe the drugs in violation of state time limits (or absolute bans) on abortion. In terms of anti-abortion states, the Biden administration’s actions have had “basically no impact,” Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor who studies abortion law, told me in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the red states have largely walled themselves off from Biden’s efforts on medication abortion, conservatives have launched a multifront attempt to roll back access to the pills nationwide. Students for Life &lt;a href="http://thisischemicalabortion.com/citizens-petition/"&gt;has filed another citizen petition&lt;/a&gt; with the FDA, arguing that doctors who prescribe the drugs must dispose of any fetal remains as medical waste. &lt;a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/Documents/news/Letter_from_Ala_Atty_Gen_Steve_Marshall_et_al_to_FDA.pdf"&gt;In a joint letter released last week&lt;/a&gt;, 22 Republican attorneys general hinted that they may sue to overturn the new FDA rules permitting pharmacies to dispense the drugs. In November, another coalition of conservative groups &lt;a href="https://adflegal.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/Alliance-for-Hippocratic-Medicine-v-FDA-2022-11-18-Complaint.pdf"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; before a Trump-appointed judge in Texas seeking to overturn the original certification and ban mifepristone. Jenny Ma, the senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, says that decision could ultimately have a broader effect than even the Supreme Court ruling overturning &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt;: “This case,” she told me,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“could effectively ban medication abortion nationwide. It means people in every state … may not be able to get abortion pills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans will also ramp up legislative action against the pills, although their proposals have no chance of becoming law while Democrats control the Senate and Biden holds the veto pen. Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi is planning to reintroduce her “&lt;a href="https://www.hydesmith.senate.gov/hyde-smith-latta-reintroduce-save-moms-babies-act"&gt;SAVE Moms and Babies Act&lt;/a&gt;,” which would restore the prohibition against dispensing abortion drugs through the mail or at pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/roe-v-wade-overturn-abortion-rights/629366/?utm_source=feed"&gt;From the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post-Roe America&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However these legal and legislative challenges are resolved, it’s already apparent that the 2024 GOP presidential field will face more pressure than before to propose executive-branch actions against the drugs. “That’s going to be our clarion call in 2024,” says Kristi Hamrick, a long-term social-conservative activist, who now serves as the chief strategist for media and policy at Students for Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie Glenn, the state-policy director at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told me that, at the least, the group wants 2024 Republican presidential candidates to press for restoring the requirement to report adverse consequences from the drugs. Former Vice President Mike Pence, a likely candidate, &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?521844-1/vice-president-mike-pence-speaks-supreme-courts-abortion-ruling"&gt;has already suggested&lt;/a&gt; that he will support a ban on dispensing the pills through the mail. But the anti-abortion movement’s long-term goal remains the same: ban mifepristone altogether. Hawkins shows the growing fervor GOP candidates will face when she says, “This pill is a cancer that has now metastasized throughout our country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, abortion-rights advocates are pushing the Biden administration to loosen restrictions even further. “Medication abortion … has been overregulated for far too long,” Ma told me. Many advocates want the FDA to extend permitted use of mifepristone from 10 to 12 weeks, eliminate the requirement that the professionals prescribing the drugs receive a special certification, and begin the process toward eventually making the drug available over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate question is whether the Biden administration will challenge the red-state laws that have stymied its efforts to expand access. Advocates &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jlb/article/9/2/lsac037/6955254"&gt;have argued that a legal case can be made&lt;/a&gt; for national FDA regulations to trump state restrictions, such as the requirement for physicians to dispense the drugs. But Biden is likely to proceed cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a lot of answers … because, frankly, states have not tried to do this stuff in hundreds of years,” Ziegler, the author of the upcoming book &lt;i&gt;Roe: The History of a National Obsession&lt;/i&gt;, told me. Even so, she added, it’s a reasonable assumption that this conservative-dominated Supreme Court would resist allowing the federal government to preempt state rules on how the drugs are dispensed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mirror-image pressures in each party increase the odds of a clear distinction between Biden (or another Democrat) and the 2024 GOP nominee over access to the drugs. Democrats are generally confident they will benefit from almost any contrast that keeps abortion prominent in the 2024 race. Some, like Lake, see access to the pills as a powerful lever to do that. The issue, she argues, is relevant to younger voters, who are much more familiar than older people with the growing use of medication abortion and are especially dubious that pharmacies can offer certain drugs in some states but not in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of abortion on the 2022 election was more complex than is often discussed. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/abortion-midterm-voters-politics-democrats-republicans-fault-lines/index.html"&gt;As I’ve written&lt;/a&gt;, in the red states that have banned or restricted the practice, such as Florida, Ohio, and Texas, there was no discernible backlash against the Republican governors or state legislators who passed those laws. But the story was different in the blue and purple states where abortion remains legal. In pivotal states including Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, a clear majority of voters said they supported abortion rights, and, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/exit-polls/national-results/house/0"&gt;according to media exit polls&lt;/a&gt;, crushing majorities of them voted against Republican gubernatorial candidates who pledged to restrict abortion. Those Democratic victories in the states likely to prove decisive again in 2024 have left many Republican strategists leery of pursuing any further constraints on abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s clear now is that even as abortion opponents gather to celebrate their long-sought toppling of &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt;, many of them won’t be satisfied until they have banned the procedure nationwide. “It is totally unacceptable for a presidential candidate to say, ‘It’s just up to the states’ now,” Marilyn Musgrave, the vice president for government affairs at the Susan B. Anthony group, told me. “We need a federal role clearly laid out by these presidential candidates.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Equally clear is that abortion opponents now view federal regulatory actions to restrict, and eventually ban, abortion drugs as a crucial interim step on that path. The U.S. may seem in some ways to be settling into an uneasy new equilibrium, with abortion banned in some states and permitted in others. But, as the escalating battle over abortion medication makes clear, access to abortion in &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; state will remain on the ballot in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ronald Brownstein</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ronald-brownstein/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8Zhx_o7nVkP9JVdlS7OzW1DA2KA=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/abortion_biden_republicans/original.jpg"><media:credit>Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Abortion Pills Will Be the Next Battle in the 2024 Election</title><published>2023-01-20T13:57:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T14:17:54-05:00</updated><summary type="html">The fight over nationwide abortion rights is only just beginning.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/medication-abortion-pill-biden-executive-branch-expand-access/672788/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672791</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;This is Work in Progress, a newsletter by Derek Thompson about work, technology, and how to solve some of America’s biggest problems. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/work-in-progress/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Sign up here to get it every week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s parent company, Alphabet, today announced that it plans to cut 12,000 jobs, joining a tech-and-media layoff list that already includes Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Salesforce, Snap, Twitter, and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to one estimate, roughly 130,000 people have been dismissed from their jobs at large tech and media companies in the past 12 months. That’s roughly equivalent to the total number of people who &lt;a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/number-of-employees"&gt;worked at Apple before&lt;/a&gt; COVID hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These layoff announcements have become depressingly common, even rote. But they’re also kind of mysterious. The overall unemployment rate in the U.S. is 3.5 percent, which ties &lt;a href="https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet"&gt;the lowest mark of the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2010s, the labor market was weak, and the tech sector was growing. During the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. economy experienced a flash-freeze depression, and the tech sector was booming. Today, the U.S. labor market seems, by some measures, quite strong, and yet the tech and media industries are bleeding. What’s going on? And what does this inversion of 21st-century norms tell us about the state of the economy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first explanation of this moment is—and I don’t know how to say this in a sophisticated way, so I’ll say it in a simple and kind of stupid-sounding way—the post-pandemic economy has been much weirder than most people anticipated. Many people predicted that the digitization of the pandemic economy in 2020, such as the rise in streaming entertainment and online food-delivery apps and at-home fitness, were “accelerations,” pushing us all into a future that was coming anyway. In this interpretation, the pandemic was a time machine, hastening the 2030s and raising tech valuations accordingly. Hiring boomed across tech, as companies added tens of thousands of workers to meet this expectation of acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the pandemic wasn’t really an accelerant. Maybe it was a bubble. Pandemic stocks, such as Peloton and Robinhood, soared and crashed. So did employment at tech companies, including Alphabet and Amazon. The challenges of the late-pandemic economy were various: Some firms faced supply-chain snafus while others were burned by the rise in interest rates that followed sticky inflation. Entertainment companies pushed their chips into streaming only to discover that profits wouldn’t follow them. But all of these companies experienced the same phenomenon: In 2020, they thought the pandemic economy was a time machine, and in 2022, they realized the pandemic economy was an oasis. So, that’s one way to see what’s happening in tech. It’s going back to 2019 again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second explanation for this weird moment is that everything in economics these days is an interest-rate story. When interest rates were low, investors valued growth narratives, and tech companies (or companies that called themselves tech companies) had a monopoly on these narratives. The price-to-earnings ratio of tech companies got out of whack, as investors placed their faith in companies such as Netflix and Uber and Tesla, which threw off a lot of long-term promises and few short-term profits. When inflation and interest rates increased, the companies that were making long-term promises were most at risk, and they got clobbered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third explanation is that much of the slowdown in tech and media is really a slowdown in advertising. Last year “was a rough year for the advertising market that saw massive pandemic-era growth come to a screeching halt,” wrote several analysts at MoffettNathanson, a media and tech research firm. Marketers slashed ad budgets “in response to a mix of actual financial struggles and anticipated future struggles until, by the end of the holidays, there was hardly any money being spent at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advertising is typically the first casualty in an economic slowdown, because it’s not spending that affects the immediate product; rather, it’s an investment in the future branding and growth of the company. Because so many tech companies—not just Google and Meta, but also Amazon, Apple, Snap, and Netflix—have become full-time or part-time advertising companies, they’re almost all sensitive to an ad slowdown that’s coming on much faster and stronger than the overall economic slowdown. So when you think about the mystery of why the tech sector is bleeding while the overall labor market seems healthy, this is a big part of the story. The advertising economy is diseased, whereas the services economy is hale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final explanation is that chief executives are normal people who navigate uncertainty by copying behavior. We can’t rule out the possibility that five-digit tech layoffs are essentially acts of mimicry or &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried/"&gt;social contagion&lt;/a&gt; among competitors. When all of your competitors are laying off 10 percent of their staff—and being rewarded by the market for it!—culling 10 percent of your workers may seem like the right or inevitable thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Was there a bubble in valuations? Absolutely,” the business professor Jeffrey Pfeffer &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stanford News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Did Meta overhire? Probably. But is that why they are laying people off? Of course not. These companies are all making money. They are doing it because other companies are doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

This collection of Long Island suburbs &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/nyregion/nassau-county-republicans-election.html"&gt;swept Democrats&lt;/a&gt; out of local office in 2021, and last fall, Nassau County voted resoundingly Republican in New York’s gubernatorial race. Most important for the national GOP, the county helped elect three Republicans to Congress, including two candidates who flipped Democratic seats in districts that President Joe Biden had carried in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representative George Santos was one of those recent winners, and now Nassau County Republicans are worried that his abrupt fall from grace will cost the GOP far more than the seat that his lies helped the party pick up in November. They want Santos to step down, even though that means his seat would be vacant until a special election later this year, which the Democrats would aggressively contest. Local Republicans are flummoxed that national party leaders, starting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, haven’t joined their united call for Santos to resign. And they see McCarthy’s continued tolerance of Santos as an attempt to hold on to a Republican vote in the near term without enough consideration for whether he’d lose it—and cause Republicans to lose many others—in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/01/george-santos-congress-lies/672692/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Tom Nichols: Amazingly, George Santos is a member of Congress&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the right thing to do morally, ethically, and politically,” former Representative Peter King, a Long Island Republican who represented the district next to Santos’s in the House for 28 years, told me about trying to oust Santos. “If you want to keep controlling the Congress, you can’t just have the short-sighted view that you need his vote next week or next month. You’re gonna lose all the votes in two years when you’re no longer in the majority.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 2024 in mind, and as the list of Santos’s biographical fabrications grows (seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/embattled-us-rep-santos-was-drag-queen-brazil-pageants-say-associates-2023-01-19/"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/18/nyregion/george-santos-mother-911.html"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/18/politics/george-santos-veteran-dog-gofundme/index.html"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;), Nassau County’s GOP machine has treated the congressman-for-now as a boil to be lanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as I’m concerned, he’s nonexistent. I will not deal with him. I will not deal with his office,” Bruce Blakeman, the Republican who was elected Nassau County executive in 2021, told me. Last week, Blakeman joined a group of local GOP leaders, including county Republican Party Chairman Joseph Cairo and Representative Anthony Garbarino, in demanding that Santos resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet for the moment, the political imperatives of Long Island Republicans no longer align with those of McCarthy, who plainly cannot afford to lose Santos’s vote with such a narrow margin in the House. Santos backed McCarthy in all 15 ballots for speaker earlier this month, and McCarthy’s allies rewarded him with a pair of committee assignments earlier this week. The new speaker said that Santos has “a long way to go to earn trust” but has made no move to sanction him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The voters of his district have elected him. He is seated. He is part of the Republican conference,” McCarthy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/12/politics/george-santos-calls-to-resign/index.html"&gt;told reporters last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats have already filed a complaint about Santos with the House Ethics Committee, and he is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/28/nyregion/george-santos-long-island-investigation.html"&gt;under investigation&lt;/a&gt; by federal and local prosecutors in New York who are reportedly looking into whether he committed financial crimes or violated federal campaign-disclosure laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos has defied calls to resign, and McCarthy might need his vote even more should another House Republican, Representative Greg Steube of Florida, miss an extended period of time after he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregSteube/status/1616070472470507522"&gt;sustained serious injuries&lt;/a&gt; from a 25-foot fall off a ladder earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCarthy’s office did not respond to requests for comment. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which traditionally backs GOP incumbents, echoed McCarthy’s ambivalence toward Santos. “Voters in New York will have the final say on who represents them,” NRCC spokesperson Jack Pandol told me by email. “Rep. Santos will have to earn back their trust as he serves them in Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/george-santos-fraud-long-island/672587/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Steve Israel: How a perfectly normal New York suburb elected a con man&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King and others in Nassau County are trying to impress upon McCarthy that the longer he stands by Santos, the more damage he will do to a Republican brand that has been on the rise. “The only reason Kevin McCarthy has the majority is because of the very close marginal seats that Republicans won in New York,” King said. “We can lose all of them in the next election.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if McCarthy wanted to force Santos out, however, there’s not much he can do. He could try to expel him, but that would take the support of two-thirds of the House, and members of both parties might be leery of setting precedent by kicking out a member who has not been charged, much less convicted, of a crime. King suggested that McCarthy insist on an expedited investigation by the Ethics Committee—the panel’s probes tend to drag on for months—but there’s little history of that either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Election to the House “is an unshakable contract for two years,” Doug Heye, a former House GOP leadership aide who has advised lawmakers ensnarled in ethics investigations, told me. “Unless two-thirds of the House say, ‘Get out of here,’ or you give it up yourself, nothing happens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos has almost no incentive to leave of his own accord anytime soon, especially now that Long Island Republicans have all but foreclosed the possibility of his winning renomination to his seat. “He’s not going to have a career. He’s not going to have a public life, and he’s going to be ostracized in his own community,” Blakeman told me. Santos was wealthy enough to lend his campaign $700,000. But his present personal finances are, like so much else about his life, a mystery, so he may need the paychecks that come with a $174,000 annual salary. And his seat could be a crucial bit of leverage in potential negotiations with prosecutors, Heye noted; resigning his seat, in that scenario, could help him avoid other penalties, including prison time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his struggle just to get the speakership demonstrated, McCarthy doesn’t exactly have an ironclad grip on his conference. The Republicans from Nassau County seem to realize that the new speaker has limited sway over Santos. But McCarthy’s decision to protect and even validate Santos’s standing inside Congress is at odds with a party clinging both to its House majority and to its precarious stronghold on Long Island. “I’ve dealt with people with all sorts of issues,” Blakeman told me,” and enabling them is not a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Russell Berman</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/russell-berman/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/iVR0Cxo56i4Z5ma1w1Sf4AQghiI=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/george_santos_nassau/original.jpg"><media:credit>Alex Brandon / AP</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Why Kevin McCarthy Can’t Lose George Santos</title><published>2023-01-20T11:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T13:47:54-05:00</updated><summary type="html">The Republican party in Santos's Long Island district wants him out.

TV deals are being negotiated at the same time as print ones. In 2020, for the first time ever, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/07/tv-adaptations-fiction/619442/?utm_source=feed"&gt;more books were made into TV series&lt;/a&gt; than into movies. Clearly, translating stories from the page to television is popular. But have we figured out the key to pulling it off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes adaptations are a breeze; there are tales that seem made for television. “Episodic plots, ensemble casts, and intricate world-building” are all signs that one might succeed, the scholars Alexander Manshel, Laura B. McGrath, and J. D. Porter argued in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/07/tv-adaptations-fiction/619442/?utm_source=feed"&gt;an article for &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Think of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/08/netflix-the-sandman-tv-show-neil-gaiman/671062/?utm_source=feed"&gt;books with lots of twists and turns&lt;/a&gt;, such as the comic-book series &lt;i&gt;The Sandman&lt;/i&gt; by Neil Gaiman, which takes full advantage of a full TV season’s long runtime to follow the source material’s narrative shifts. For other works, however, moving to television can drain the introspection out of the story. The Hulu rendition of &lt;i&gt;Conversations With Friends&lt;/i&gt;, for example, loses the darkness and humor of Sally Rooney’s narration and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/05/conversations-with-friends-hulu-review/629918/?utm_source=feed"&gt;replaces it with … nothing&lt;/a&gt;. The Apple TV+&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;miniseries based on Min Jin Lee’s &lt;i&gt;Pachinko&lt;/i&gt; also lacks the novel’s intimate feeling—perhaps because of the decision to restructure the narrative in a way that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/03/pachinko-apple-tv-series-review/627071/?utm_source=feed"&gt;distanced viewers from the book’s most central character&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the risk of adapting a title that doesn’t seem like a natural fit for television pays off, the resulting shows can both stand on their own and offer new ways of looking at the original. Take Elena Ferrante’s &lt;i&gt;The Lying Life of Adults&lt;/i&gt;, a novel characterized by its narrator’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/01/lying-life-of-adults-netflix-review-elena-ferrante/672741/?utm_source=feed"&gt;fragmented and sometimes unreliable perception&lt;/a&gt;. TV cannot convey the holes in her discernment, so instead, the show immerses the viewer in close-up shots of faces and moody soundscapes that brilliantly evoke the feeling of being inside the protagonist’s mind. The adaptation of Celeste Ng’s &lt;i&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; takes another approach to depicting literary ambiguity: &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/little-fires-everywhere-hulu-series-pivotal-change-from-novel/609151/?utm_source=feed"&gt;by making a bold choice&lt;/a&gt;. Although Ng’s novel leaves the race of a few key characters unclear, the network casts Black actors in those roles, bringing the tensions simmering below the book’s surface to the forefront. You won’t read it the same way after watching—nor should you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

Considering he’d spent much of his life fascinated by crime, it nevertheless came as a shock, to him and others, when he was sentenced to three days on a contempt-of-court charge. “I've been in thirty or forty jails and prisons, but this is the first time I’ll ever be in one as a prisoner,” Capote told reporters at the time, his bravado a substitute, according to &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781439187500"&gt;his biographer&lt;/a&gt; Gerald Clarke, for the “stark terror” he was actually feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every true-crime writer has to contend with Capote. &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/%E2%80%8E%200679745580"&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his rapturously received “nonfiction novel” (as Capote termed it) about a Kansas family’s homicide in 1959, is embedded in the DNA of every book in the genre. As Justin St. Germain wrote in his &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/truman-capote-s-in-cold-blood-bookmarked-justin-st-germain/14211607"&gt;critical reexamination&lt;/a&gt;, “Capote spiked a vein, and out came a stream of imitators, a whole bloody genre, one of the most popular forms of American nonfiction: true crime.” (I’m no exception, as Capote ended up a minor character in my own recent nonfiction book, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/0062899767"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scoundrel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer glut of recently released books and films about Capote—the past few years alone brought forth &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/0593328086"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Capote’s Women&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;by Laurence Leamer; the documentary film &lt;i&gt;The Capote Tapes&lt;/i&gt;; and, at the end of last year, Roseanne Montillo’s &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/1982153733"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deliberate Cruelty: Truman Capote, the Millionaire’s Wife, and the Murder of the Century&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—seem less interested in Capote’s relationship to true crime than in his obsessive social striving. The two parts of his identity were not completely separate—the smash success of his Black and White Ball at the Plaza Hotel in November 1966 was built, after all, on the back of &lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/i&gt;’s runaway popularity. But surely there must be something new to discover about Capote’s relationship to criminality? If so, uncovering how he came to spend time (however brief) among the incarcerated may yield some clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he went to jail in 1970, Capote wasn’t far removed from his heights as one of America’s most celebrated writers. He had also, improbably, become a go-to pundit on criminal-justice matters, opining about criminal cases on popular programs such as &lt;i&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Firing Line&lt;/i&gt;, and spending years interviewing death-row prisoners for various projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s no accident that Capote’s career and personal free fall began in earnest after his time in jail, a surprisingly little-reported episode that raises larger questions about his own attraction to true crime, and the ethical compromises involved in doing this sort of writing. Understanding how and why this happened requires a look back at Capote’s troubled youth, which foreshadowed an adulthood marked by secrets and lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;C&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;apote’s biological father,&lt;/span&gt; Arch Persons, was a con man whose wife, Lillie Mae, summarily abandoned him when she realized he couldn’t deliver on the financial promises he’d made her. Reinventing herself as Nina, she took up with her second husband, Joe Capote, a Cuban émigré who had a taste for the finer things, even if it meant spending more money than he made. Nina and Joe lived an extravagant lifestyle in New York City and Greenwich, Connecticut. But according to Clarke’s biography as well as George Plimpton’s &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/131861/truman-capote-by-george-plimpton/9780385491730"&gt;1997 oral history&lt;/a&gt;, its demands led to Joe’s arrest for embezzlement, a guilty plea, and a year-long stint in Sing Sing Correctional Facility in 1955. By that time, Nina was dead of a Seconal overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capote’s relationship with his mother was ambivalent at best, tortured at worst—he often described his earliest memory, from around the age of 2, as being abandoned in a hotel room. Even after Nina and Joe married, young Truman spent the bulk of his childhood in Monroeville, Alabama, living with his cousins. There, he befriended not only Harper Lee—who would serve as his co-reporter and amanuensis for what would become &lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/i&gt;—but also Martha Seabrook, an older girl who’d landed in Monroeville from Milton, Florida, and who lived across the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/in-search-of-the-real-truman-capote/403978/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: In search of the real Truman Capote&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime during the summer of 1934 or 1935, either Capote or Seabrook got the notion to run away to Evergreen, Alabama, where Seabrook’s uncle owned a hotel. Their journey lasted a single night before they had to return to Monroeville. That fall, Capote went back to New York to join his mother and stepfather, and Seabrook’s family moved away. They never saw each other again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, Capote learned what had happened to Seabrook. As Martha Beck, she took up with Raymond Fernandez, and their poisonous alchemy led to multiple murders, mostly of women who answered “lonely hearts” ads. Both Fernandez and Beck were executed at Sing Sing in 1951. “I didn’t even realize it was the same person until years later all my relatives in that town said: ‘Oh, that’s the girl who was here that summer. She’s the one you ran away with,’” Capote told an interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years after Beck’s execution and four years after his stepfather’s imprisonment in the same correctional institution, Capote infamously alighted on a wire story about the Clutter family’s homicide in Holcomb, Kansas. He would tell more grandiose and authoritative versions of &lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/i&gt;’s origin story. He minimized Lee’s pivotal role as a researcher and fellow journalist on the project; obfuscated the truth about his relationship with Perry Smith, one of the murderers; grew petulant about the lack of resolution when Smith and Dick Hickok’s execution dates kept getting postponed; and fabricated incidents when it suited his narrative, including the book’s final scene (in which the lead investigator visits the Clutter family’s graves with the daughter’s best friend).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronicling and identifying with the ultimate transgressors—murderers—became Capote’s career calling card. Doing so was a way of empathizing with society’s underclass, yes, but it also gave Capote the opportunity to bend stories to his will, because readers would be more inclined to trust his version over the murderers’. Playing fast and loose with the truth might have been accepted at the time in literary and high-society circles, but when Capote was faced with the stringencies of the legal system and the consequences of actual jail time, his storytelling instincts would prove to be his undoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="full-width"&gt;&lt;img alt="Picture of Truman Capote interviewing prisoners at San Quentin" height="644" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/img/posts/2023/01/GettyImages_1135158654_1/9bd5a77f1.jpg" width="928"&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Truman Capote interviewing prisoners for the late-night special “Truman Capote at San Quentin,” in San Quentin, California, 1973 (Disney General Entertainment Content / Getty)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;F&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;rom 1967 to 1968,&lt;/span&gt; Capote interviewed more than two dozen prisoners housed in three different death-row facilities: Oregon and Colorado State Penitentiaries and San Quentin State Prison. He did so at the behest of ABC, which had commissioned Capote to create and host a documentary that would, in the executives’ minds, be a natural follow-up to &lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the murderers who would appear on camera in &lt;i&gt;Death Row, U.S.A. &lt;/i&gt;(and be quoted in print in the accompanying October 1968 &lt;a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/1968/10/1/death-row-u-s-a"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Esquire&lt;/i&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;) were incarcerated at San Quentin, which Capote visited on several occasions. There, he met and spoke with Joseph Morse. Morse was originally sentenced to death for the murders of his mother and disabled younger sister in 1962, but his conviction was overturned on a technicality. While awaiting a new trial, Morse killed a fellow prisoner after a dispute over cigarettes, resulting in yet &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; death sentence that would eventually be overturned (both times, Morse was resentenced to life imprisonment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My problem is I’m a case afflicted with severe sociopathy. I can’t change because I can’t benefit by experience. Experience teaches me nothing,” Capote quoted Morse as saying in the &lt;i&gt;Esquire &lt;/i&gt;article. But it was Morse’s next series of quoted comments that landed Capote in hot water in the fall of 1970: “If I were to get out of here tomorrow, I’d probably kill again. Do it without any thought of the death penalty. Even though I’ve already spent five years on Death Row and know full well what it means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Orange County prosecutor tasked with resentencing Morse to death wanted Capote to testify about these comments. Capote had no intention of doing so, “believing, like any other honorable reporter, that interviews are confidential,” according to Clarke, his biographer. Capote fled to New York as his lawyers tried and failed to work things out. The judge, exasperated by all the goings-on, finally had enough and gave Capote his jail sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at his bungalow in Bel-Air, Capote took several pills, retreated to bed, and ordered one of his lawyers, Alan Schwartz, to “call Ronald Reagan!” But even the then-governor of California couldn’t help. Capote went to jail, though his sentence would be reduced to a mere 18 hours because of ill health. Schwartz told Clarke that Capote, after his release, seemed “as if he had been raped, rolled, and beaten up.” (Capote, meanwhile, never described the ordeal in any detail beyond saying “It was very uncomfortable in there” and “I don’t advise anybody to go there to write a book.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/true-detectives-serial-the-jinx/393575/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The new true crime&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there would have been greater dignity in this episode if &lt;i&gt;Death Row, U.S.A. &lt;/i&gt;had had some impact. But the documentary for which Capote had interviewed Morse&lt;a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/10/31/76900423.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;amp;ip=0"&gt; never aired&lt;/a&gt;. By 1968, the ABC executive (a friend of Capote’s) who had green-lit the project had left the network, and the new man in charge judged it “too grim” and refused to broadcast it. (Capote, furious, later retorted, “Well, what were you expecting, &lt;i&gt;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&lt;/i&gt;?”)&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capote tried to brush off the failed documentary as proof that he should stick to books. Still, it had to be devastating to see a project begun with the best of intentions killed before it could even reach an audience. Save for a single theatrical screening at a theater in Manhattan—an event organized and funded by Capote himself—&lt;i&gt;Death Row, U.S.A. &lt;/i&gt;has never been shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capote made several more attempts to recapture the &lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood &lt;/i&gt;magic, including &lt;i&gt;Truman Capote Behind Prison Walls&lt;/i&gt; in 1972, another ill-fated documentary for ABC about the life of the incarcerated (although this program actually aired, the critical reception and ratings were poor). Then came “Handcarved Coffins,” the centerpiece of Capote’s 1980 collection, &lt;i&gt;Music for Chameleons&lt;/i&gt;;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the story purported to chronicle a number of unsolved murders that bordered on the bizarre. Because Capote still had lingering credibility as a criminal-justice expert, readers and critics&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1992/07/19/capotes-coffins/7020e401-3adc-47da-a622-5b2ee6ff4018/"&gt; took the story at face value&lt;/a&gt;, believing it to be a true and accurate account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the investigating “homespun” detective, Clarke wrote, “was not a real person, but a composite of several lawmen [Capote] had known.” And a 1992 &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times &lt;/i&gt;story, published eight years after Capote’s death,&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313115528/http://reprints.longform.org/hoax-truman-capote-secret"&gt; offered even more proof &lt;/a&gt;that “Handcarved Coffins” was pure fiction. Once again, Capote had chosen story over the truth. And if one takes the word of Morse, the murderer whose published comments legally imperiled the author, making things up was also the reason Capote went to jail in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;M&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;orse wrote and edited&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;i&gt;San Quentin News&lt;/i&gt; during &lt;a href="https://narratively.com/marrying-a-monster/"&gt;his long incarceration there&lt;/a&gt;, several stints over nearly 30 years. (He died in 2009 in a different correctional facility.) When the &lt;i&gt;Behind Prison Walls&lt;/i&gt; documentary aired in December 1972, the editor of the satirical anti-establishment magazine &lt;i&gt;The Realist&lt;/i&gt; wrote to Morse soliciting his opinion of the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse was withering in his assessment of what he called “this fiasco,” a distortion of life at San Quentin. (“If asked to ‘review’ this film, I would say it was one of the best rip-offs I have seen in quite a while,” he said.) Morse also told his version of what had happened with the contempt-of-court case. During Morse’s conversation with Capote back in 1968, the writer had asked him, “If you were to get out right now do you think you could kill again?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse took his time answering. He knew that if he got out, “I would revert to being a smack freak—which would engender a need for money,” which might then necessitate a need to murder somebody. When Morse finally replied, he reported that he’d said “Probably” without elaborating. But his “terse, one-word reply” had been embellished in Capote’s magazine article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This put Capote in a bind. “He could testify that I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; make the statement, but then he would have to try to explain why the transcription of the interview contained no such quote,” Morse wrote. “The transcription would have really fucked him, and he had only one alternative. He would have to tell the truth and admit that my answer was, simply, ‘Probably.’ This, too, would have fucked him because he would then have to admit that he lied to &lt;i&gt;Esquire &lt;/i&gt;(and the public). He was fucked either way. As a result, he split and ignored the subpoena.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to know if Capote ever saw Morse’s comments in &lt;i&gt;The Realist&lt;/i&gt;; he never disputed or confirmed them. If Morse was correct, testifying in open court would have put Capote’s credibility on the line at a time when he had maximum goodwill and authority. Not doing so, however, set Capote up to make poor decision after poor decision, and the blurred lines between fiction and reality destroyed friendships, wrecked his writing and health, and ruined his credibility after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The costs of Capote’s repeated inability to contend with factuality weren’t felt only by him; they also permeated throughout the genre he’d redefined almost single-handedly with &lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/i&gt;. As the crime journalist Jack Olsen &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100603035325/http://www.jackolsen.com/point.htm"&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt;, “That book did two things. It made true crime an interesting, successful, commercial genre, but it also began the process of tearing it down.” The past few years in particular have made us question whose crime stories get credence and attention.

Oh wait: That’s out of date now, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This week alone we’ve learned that Santos’s mother, who he said was in the Twin Towers on 9/11 and died years later from complications, probably &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/18/santos-mother-sept-11/"&gt;wasn’t even in the United States that day&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve heard an &lt;a href="https://patch.com/new-york/oysterbay/disabled-veteran-george-santos-took-3k-dying-dogs-gofundme"&gt;allegation&lt;/a&gt; that he stole $3,000 he had raised for a military veteran’s ailing dog, a story that seems too cartoonish to make up. We’ve also seen a photo that a Brazilian drag queen &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/embattled-us-rep-santos-was-drag-queen-brazil-pageants-say-associates-2023-01-19/"&gt;insists is Santos in drag&lt;/a&gt;, though he denies it. In more scandalous sartorial news, a former roommate says that the scarf Santos sported at a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/santos-wore-stolen-burberry-scarf-tol-rally-report-2023-1"&gt;Stop the Steal rally was, fittingly, stolen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you’re unable to laugh at these stories, you should check your pulse. But if you’re only laughing at them, you should check your head. The Santos story is funny, but a real danger exists that the public might allow its amusement to eclipse the horror of such a candidate reaching office and the consequences for Congress and the American political system’s remaining shreds of repute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/01/george-santos-congress-lies/672692/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Tom Nichols: Amazingly, George Santos is a member of Congress&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Voters have a right to know whether the people they vote for are who they say they are. In Santos’s case, even the fact of his name is marshy; many former acquaintances say he used to go by “Anthony Devolder”—his middle name and mother’s maiden name—and detested what one might call his government name, in two senses of the word. In response to his ill-gained success, some of his critics, including other members of Congress, have suggested bills that would require something like truth in advertising for political candidates, an approach both legally dubious—any sufficiently sweeping bill would probably violate the First Amendment—and more broadly imprudent, the latest example of Americans seeking to enlist the justice system to do work the political system can and should do better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That said, Santos ought to be investigated to see whether he broke any existing laws. He already faces complaints before the House Ethics Committee and Federal Election Commission &lt;a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/01/13/legal-woes-grow-for-george-santos-fec-complaint/"&gt;about his campaign spending&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a larger question about how Santos, who was previously strapped for cash, per his own disclosures, suddenly got the money to loan his campaign $700,000. Brazilian authorities have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/02/nyregion/george-santos-brazil.html"&gt;revived&lt;/a&gt; a long-moribund fraud investigation against him there, too. In the meantime, he’s in Congress, where he recently won placement on committees on small business and science, space, and technology, and he may get access to classified information, a privilege afforded to members of the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Politics has always had its share of oddball stories, but the country seems to be suffering through an epidemic of funny-but-not-funny episodes. A recent example—in which Santos had a walk-on role—was the tortuous election of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House on the 15th ballot, after days of failures. The speaker election was as riveting as any process that takes place over several days on the House floor can possibly be. For excitement and length, it would certainly beat out a cricket test match. The human drama was irresistible (for a certain type of nerd—present company included). But it was not low-stakes. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/republican-party-kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker-debt-ceiling/672645/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The functionality of the government was on the line&lt;/a&gt;, most urgently in the matter of whether Congress will raise the debt limit in time to avoid a national default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The apotheosis of this dynamic is Donald Trump, who can be very funny by intent and often by accident (“very legal &amp;amp; very cool”), even when (or especially when) his behavior is boorish and unbecoming of a leader. Trump is &lt;em&gt;entertaining&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense that he provides hours of diversion and he emerged from the world of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Figures like this don’t necessarily act the way they do to be amusing, but they know that throwing a three-ring circus can relegate their truly bad behavior to the sideshow tent. To borrow a different metaphor, their approach helps feed what Patrick Hruby has called “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/01/the-sportscenter-ization-of-political-journalism/250882/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the SportsCenter-ization of political journalism&lt;/a&gt;,” in which “coverage of Washington—and the world, really—apes a glossy entertainment product dedicated to spectacular touchdowns, gee-whiz statistics, [and] prefabricated drama.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/george-santos-fraud-long-island/672587/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Steve Israel: How a perfectly normal New York suburb elected a con man&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jon Stewart, who in his previous guise as host of&lt;em&gt; The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt; was both a lucid critic and a major catalyst of politics-as-entertainment, connected Santos to Trump in this respect this week. “The thing we have to be careful of, and I always caution myself on this and I ran into this trouble with Trump, is we cannot mistake absurdity for lack of danger, because it takes people with no shame to do shameful things,” &lt;a href="https://politicalwire.com/2023/01/18/quote-of-the-day-3432/"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Santos is eventually forced out of office, as seems possible, treating him like a mere joke risks feeding a vicious cycle that will persist after his exit. When clowns get elected, it rightly lowers the esteem in which the public holds Congress; this, in turn, leads voters to be more apt to elect more clowns, which only produces a Congress even less worthy of respect. So go ahead, laugh at George Santos. But when your giggles peter out, don’t let your attention drift away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David A.

American children confront challenges as varied as bullying, poverty, gangs, sexual abuse, mental illness, and drug addiction. A state legislator hoping to protect kids might reasonably focus on any number of issues. Drag shows, those improbable culture-war flash points, are not among them. Yet Republican legislators in at least &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-10/drag-shows-are-the-next-target-for-republican-lawmakers"&gt;seven states&lt;/a&gt; are pushing bills to restrict shows where performers may deviate from traditional gender norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most sweeping and objectionable proposals are not mere efforts to deprive drag shows of taxpayer funding or to keep them out of public primary schools. Rather, they would classify drag shows (as the sponsoring legislators variously define them) as akin to pornography. They would redefine any venue hosting such a show as an adult business, or try to shield even teenagers from drag in a society where almost all of them have regular access to the internet. Should any such proposal pass into law––at this early stage, their prospects are uncertain and may vary from state to state—the free speech and association rights of private venues, performers, artists, and willing audiences will all be infringed upon. And for what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/rupauls-drag-race-and-the-art-of-self-love/482265/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: RuPaul’s Drag Race and the art of self-love&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proposals are needless, excessive, and unconstitutional––so much so that more than one would belong in a Hall of Fame for legislative overreach that is at odds with freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents expose young kids to all sorts of things that strike me as age inappropriate, including the most hypersexualized drag shows that circulate via aggregators such as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/04/doxxing-meaning-libs-of-tiktok/629643/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Libs of TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, which are outliers. Meanwhile, mountains of inappropriate movies, TV shows, video games, and internet content exceed the relative molehill of inappropriate drag performances (which would be just as inappropriate if cisgender women performed the same actions), whether measured by the ease of accessibility to kids or how many total kids see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstractly, the question of how many people need to be harmed to justify a new state law can be a difficult one. But I can find no evidence that &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;child has been harmed as the result of a drag performance. One suspects that some GOP legislators see drag shows not as especially big problems so much as big opportunities because a faction of their constituents zealously dislike them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of motivation, any Constitution-respecting American should reject a law that infringes on free speech or artistic expression if the matter in question has zero proven victims. Some supporters of anti-drag laws maintain that drag shows have the effect of “grooming” kids into LGBTQ activism or an LGBTQ lifestyle. But that claim is speculative and unproven––and even if it were true that drag shows influence how kids think about gender, neither art nor free speech can survive if it is constitutionally unprotected anytime it influences how some of the children who witness it think. Of course, once drag-queen story hours for children weirdly became both progressive acculturation events and culture-war battlegrounds, attempted interventions in statehouses was inevitable. Perhaps it was also inevitable that many proposals would go further than is legal. Neither faction is committed to butting out when private undertakings offend its sensibilities. In this matter the Republicans are in the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Nebraska, where the &lt;a href="https://www.ned.uscourts.gov/internetDocs/outreach/NSBF-Age-of-Majority-2011.pdf"&gt;age of majority is 19&lt;/a&gt;, a law proposed by State Senator Dave Murman would prohibit anyone 18 or younger from being present at a drag show, which it defines expansively, &lt;a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/108/PDF/Intro/LB371.pdf"&gt;as follows&lt;/a&gt;: First, the performance’s “main aspect” is “a performer which exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer's gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers.” (I’d have thought a conservative would say that one’s &lt;em&gt;sex&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;recorded&lt;/em&gt; at birth, not that one’s &lt;em&gt;gender&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;assigned&lt;/em&gt;, but set that aside.) Second, “the performer sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs before an audience for entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By that definition, an 18-year-old would be legally prohibited from attending a performance of &lt;a href="https://mrsdoubtfirebroadway.com/"&gt;the Broadway musical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Doubtfire&lt;/em&gt;, a comedy set by Eddie Izzard, a lecture on being trans by Caitlyn Jenner, or a rock concert by a female-and-costumed Beatles tribute band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed Nebraska law goes on: “Any person nineteen years of age or older who knowingly brings an individual under nineteen years of age to a drag show shall be guilty of a Class I misdemeanor.” That standard would have made criminals of numerous World War II officers, what with &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Coming_Out_Under_Fire/_mfexYFbzL4C?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=%E2%80%9CFrom+Broadway+to+Guadalcanal,+on+the+backs+of+trucks,+makeshift+platforms,+and+elegant+theater+stages,+American+GIs+did+put+on+all-male+shows+for+each+other+that+almost+always+featured+female+impersonation+routines.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;pg=PA67&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;the ubiquity of drag shows&lt;/a&gt; performed by and for troops overseas during that era. (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbBZRnWoPbY"&gt;Ronald Reagan introducing a dramatization of one&lt;/a&gt; of those shows circa 1943.) I had hoped to question Murman about the breadth of entertainment that his proposal would constrain and the conduct that it would criminalize, but a spokesperson declined an interview invitation while passing along the prepared statement “I will always uphold my promise to enact policies that reflect Judeo-Christian values and defend the innocence of children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what 18-year-old’s innocence would be ruined by &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Doubtfire&lt;/em&gt;? A law can prohibit showing some expressive material to minors that would be legal for adults &lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1967/47"&gt;without violating the First Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s hard to imagine Nebraska’s expansive definition passing an obscenity test.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic State Senator Megan Hunt is &lt;a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/aclu-condemns-proposed-drag-show-ban-as-part-of-national-effort-to-push-lgbtq-people-out-of-public-life/"&gt;opposing&lt;/a&gt; the bill. A spokesperson in her office said that they intend to fight it but that defeating it may be an uphill battle that requires engagement from the public because Republicans enjoy a supermajority in the state legislature. Neither the bill nor an attempt by Hunt to indefinitely delay it has yet been debated on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Arkansas, one &lt;a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FSB43.pdf"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; would amend the definition of adult-oriented businesses to include drag performances. That bill is less egregious than its Nebraska analogue in that only drag shows “intended to appeal to the prurient interest” are affected, but it’s more restrictive in that it doesn’t just affect performances in which drag is “the main element”––even one extra in drag could trigger the law. It is hardly novel for legislators to seek to protect minors from performances that are “prurient,” which is to say, that appeal to &lt;a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/prurient-interest"&gt;a lustful interest in sexual stimulation or gratification&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s striking to draft a law that shields kids from ostensibly prurient performances &lt;em&gt;only when the performers are cross-dressing&lt;/em&gt;. The approach seems to subject genderqueer people to unequal treatment under the law and suggests animus against them, failing another civil-rights test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/first-amendment-regulation/617827/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Genevieve Lakier: The great free-speech reversal&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly speech-infringing and chilling proposals are circulating in a number of other states. In Arizona, S.B. 1030 would classify and regulate establishments that conduct drag shows in the same way as adult arcades, massage parlors, and strip clubs. It defines a drag performer as “a person who dresses in clothing and uses makeup and other physical markers opposite of the person’s gender at birth to exaggerate gender signifiers and roles and engages in singing, dancing, or a monologue or skit in order to entertain an audience.” Under that definition, &lt;a href="https://www.footprintcenter.com/events/rod-stewart/"&gt;Rod Stewart’s upcoming concert&lt;/a&gt; at the arena where the Phoenix Suns play could conceivably result in its reclassification as an 18-and-up venue––while not generally thought of as a drag act, he has &lt;a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/in-pictures-rod-stewarts-fashion-highlights--709598485018969339/"&gt;frequently styled himself&lt;/a&gt; in ways that incorporate normatively feminine looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Texas Monthly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-bill-jared-patterson-drag-shows/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on an effort by State Representative Jared Patterson to treat venues that host “drag performances” as “sexually oriented businesses,” noting that if the bill passes, “a rock club or a community theater that doesn’t offer sexually explicit performances could find itself governed by the same rules” as strip clubs and porn theaters. “Given the stakes, those venues may well be unlikely to offer trans performers—even if they’re just strumming guitars or sitting behind drum kits—the opportunity to play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That analysis seems reasonable to me, and demonstrates how the bill would obviously discourage artistic expression and would presumptively make it disproportionately harder for trans performers to get work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Tennessean&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/10/tennessee-bill-could-criminalize-some-drag-show-performances/69636737007/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that State Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson is &lt;a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB0003&amp;amp;GA=113"&gt;sponsoring legislation&lt;/a&gt;, S.B. 3, that is written broadly enough to conceivably encompass the actions in a bawdy sketch like the one that Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spn0MJZr-QQ"&gt;performed in drag together back in 2000&lt;/a&gt; if it was performed in a place where a child could see it. The effect of that proposal, too, would be to chill all manner of speech and artistic expression for cis and trans performers who depart from the traditional gender norms of their sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar bills are under consideration in &lt;a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article270346107.html"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/dec/29/columbia-falls-legislator-drafts-bill-prohibit-chi/"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;. One wonders if more are coming. Even if none passes, it is notable that legislators in so many states are singling out drag, especially in ways that raise significant constitutional problems. And should any bill pass aiming to restrict drag performances anywhere a child might see one, legal challenges will follow. As the UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment expert, told me in a phone interview, the precedent in the 1975 Supreme Court case &lt;em&gt;Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville &lt;/em&gt;would be relevant. In that case, a Jacksonville, Florida, ordinance made it a punishable offense for a drive-in movie theater to show films containing nudity when the screen was visible from the street. The Supreme Court struck the ordinance down on First Amendment grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Much that we encounter offends our esthetic, if not our political and moral, sensibilities,” &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/422/205"&gt;it ruled&lt;/a&gt;. “Nevertheless, the Constitution does not permit government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/free-speech-cliches-media-should-stop-using/596506/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Don’t use these free-speech arguments ever again&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court went on to address concerns about children. “Appellee maintains that even though it cannot prohibit the display of films containing nudity to adults, the present ordinance is a reasonable means of protecting minors from this type of visual influence,” the majority opinion states. The opinion points out that “the ordinance is not directed against sexually explicit nudity, nor is it otherwise limited. Rather, it sweepingly forbids display of all films containing any uncovered buttocks or breasts, irrespective of context or pervasiveness.” The ruling concludes that  “speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them. In most circumstances, the values protected by the First Amendment are no less applicable when government seeks to control the flow of information to minors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own estimation, the state’s ability to control the flow of information to minors should be at its very weakest in cases where parents or guardians are in favor of exposing their children to the art or expression in question. And most young children who attend drag shows of any sort do so &lt;em&gt;because their parents chose to take them&lt;/em&gt;. In an &lt;a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/drag-queen-conservatism-eb1"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; where the journalist and pioneering proponent of gay equality Andrew Sullivan both celebrates many types of drag performances and laments as regressive progressivism “the idea that a drag queen—rather than, say, a firefighter or a pilot or a tennis player—is somehow an ideal role model for young gay children,” he points out that drag-queen story hour is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a voluntary activity. It’s not compulsory. Parents can choose to take their kids or not. (The introduction of this into public schools where kids cannot opt out and parents aren’t told is &lt;a href="https://substack.com/redirect/19466701-463c-4f4c-be98-6c395fe1be48?u=840445"&gt;another matter entirely&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either you believe in parents’ rights, or you don’t. And I’m happy to leave it up to parents—and no one else. The post-liberal right, we have come to understand, only believes in parents’ rights if the parents are social conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the legislation discussed above goes far beyond trying to unconstitutionally ban drag-queen story hours, similarly infringing on a wide array of performative events, even though, as the ACLU of Nebraska’s Jane Seu put it in &lt;a href="https://www.aclunebraska.org/en/press-releases/aclu-nebraska-calls-senators-reject-drag-show-ban"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;, “Families have a First Amendment right to attend these events and performers and venues have a right to offer them.” Free-speech claims are often denigrated by neo-puritan factions on the right and left these days, but they remain an essential bulwark protecting minority communities from would-be censors. If the GOP improbably succeeds in overcoming those claims, its Pyrrhic crusade against drag will triumph at the expense of individual liberty and expressive rights for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Conor Friedersdorf</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/conor-friedersdorf/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/KvCf83FwRMLsq-lQCkoBHkss164=/1x24:990x580/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/NYC61275_copy/original.jpg"><media:credit>Constantine Manos / Magnum</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Drag Shows Are Free Speech</title><published>2023-01-20T06:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T12:27:11-05:00</updated><summary type="html">Efforts by GOP legislators to impose absurd and onerous regulations on them violate the Constitution.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/drag-shows-free-speech-gop-constitution/672768/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672767</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the next five years, it is likely that AI will begin to reduce employment for college-educated workers. As the technology continues to advance, it will be able to perform tasks that were previously thought to require a high level of education and skill. This could lead to a displacement of workers in certain industries, as companies look to cut costs by automating processes. While it is difficult to predict the exact extent of this trend, it is clear that AI will have a significant impact on the job market for college-educated workers. It will be important for individuals to stay up to date on the latest developments in AI and to consider how their skills and expertise can be leveraged in a world where machines are increasingly able to perform many tasks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There you have it, I guess: ChatGPT is coming for my job and yours, according to ChatGPT itself. The artificially intelligent content creator, whose name is short for “Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” was released two months ago by OpenAI, one of the country’s most influential artificial-intelligence research laboratories. The technology is, put simply, amazing. It generated that first paragraph instantly, working with this prompt: “Write a five-sentence paragraph in the style of &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; about whether AI will begin to reduce employment for college-educated workers in the next five years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is just one of many mind-blowing generative AI tools released recently, including the image generators &lt;a href="https://midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F"&gt;Midjourney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/"&gt;DALL-E&lt;/a&gt; and the video generator &lt;a href="http://synthesia.io/"&gt;Synthesia&lt;/a&gt;. The upside of these AI tools is easy to see: They’re going to produce a tremendous amount of digital content, quickly and cheaply. Students are already using ChatGPT to help them write essays. Businesses are using ChatGPT to create copy for their websites and promotional materials, and to respond to customer-service inquiries. Lawyers are using it to produce legal briefs (ChatGPT passes the torts and evidence sections &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4314839"&gt;of the Multistate Bar Examination&lt;/a&gt;, by the way) and academics to produce footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-writing-college-student-essays/672371/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Will ChatGPT kill the student essay?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet an extraordinary downside is also easy to see: What happens when services like ChatGPT start putting copywriters, journalists, customer-service agents, paralegals, coders, and digital marketers out of a job? For years, tech thinkers have been warning that flexible, creative AI will be a threat to white-collar employment, as robots replace skilled office workers whose jobs were once considered immune to automation. In the most extreme iteration, analysts imagine AI altering the &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/9780316414210"&gt;employment landscape&lt;/a&gt; permanently. One Oxford study estimates that &lt;a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf"&gt;47 percent&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. jobs might be at risk.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single technology in modern memory has caused mass job loss among highly educated workers. Will generative AI really be an exception? No one can answer this question, given how new the technology is and given how slowly employment can adjust in response to technological change. But AI really is different, technology experts told me—a range of tasks that up until now were impossible to automate are becoming automatable. “Before, progress was linear and predictable. You figured out the steps and the computer followed them. It followed the procedure; it didn’t learn and it didn’t improvise,” the MIT professor David Autor, one of the world’s foremost experts on employment and technological change, told me. ChatGPT and the like &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; improvise, promising to destabilize a lot of white-collar work, regardless of whether they eliminate jobs or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People and businesses are just figuring out how to use emerging AI technologies, let alone how to use them to create new products, streamline their business operations, and make employees more efficient. If history is any guide, this process could take longer than you might think. &lt;a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/233032140/fulltextPDF"&gt;Consider electricity&lt;/a&gt;. The circuit, electric lights, and rudimentary electric motors were developed in the early 1800s. But another century passed before the widespread adoption of electricity in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/233032140/fulltextPDF"&gt;began to lift GDP&lt;/a&gt;. Or take computers. They became &lt;a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/1951/#169ebbe2ad45559efbc6eb35720347da"&gt;commercially available&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1950s but did not show up in the productivity stats until the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some technologies clearly improve productivity and reduce the need for labor. &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/202211/labor-market-effects-machine-tool-automation"&gt;Automated machine tools&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, depress manufacturing employment while lifting output and productivity, as do many of the forms of machinery invented and employed since the Industrial Revolution. But other technologies—even amazing ones—show surprisingly muted effects. How about the internet, which has revolutionized almost every facet of communications in the past four decades? Despite altering how we date and talk and read and watch and vote and emote and record our own life stories, launching a zillion businesses, and creating however many fortunes, the internet “fails the hurdle test as a Great Invention,” the economist Robert Gordon &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w7833"&gt;argued in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, because it “provides information and entertainment more cheaply and conveniently than before, but much of its use involves substitution of existing activities from one medium to another.” Nearly a quarter century later, the internet still &lt;a href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/wp12-18bk.pdf"&gt;hasn’t spurred&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c14007/c14007.pdf"&gt;productivity revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Smartphones haven’t either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is AI like the smartphone or is it like an automated machine tool? Is it about to change the way that work gets done without eliminating many jobs in aggregate, or is it about to turn San Francisco into the Rust Belt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predicting where technology will cause job losses is hard, Autor noted. Remember the freak-out several years ago over the possibility of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/self-driving-technology-threatens-nearly-300-000-trucking-jobs-report-says-1536053401"&gt;self-driving automobiles&lt;/a&gt; eliminating work for truck drivers? But AI is much more flexible than a system like Excel, much more creative than a Google Doc. What’s more, AI systems get better and better and better as they get more use and absorb more data, whereas engineers often need to laboriously and painstakingly update other types of software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What happens when AI has read everything?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a rule, when companies can substitute machines for people, they will. AI can do work currently done by paralegals, copywriters, digital-content producers, executive assistants, entry-level &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danshipper/status/1609931358213935105"&gt;computer programmers&lt;/a&gt;, and, yes, some journalists. That means such jobs might change, and soon. But even if ChatGPT can spit out a pretty good paragraph on AI, it can’t interview AI and labor experts, nor can it find historical documents, nor can it assess the quality of studies of technological change and employment. It creates content out of what is already out there, with no authority, no understanding, no ability to correct itself, no way to identify genuinely new or interesting ideas. That implies that AI might make original journalism more valuable and investigative journalists more productive, while creating an enormous profusion of simpler content. AI might spit out listicles and summaries of public meetings, while humans will write in-depth stories. “In many ways, AI will help people use expertise better,” Autor said. “It means that we’ll specialize more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/artificial-intelligence-will-make-your-job-even-harder/597625/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Fred Benenson: AI is coming for your favorite menial tasks&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI could also make a wide variety of industries more efficient, with muted effects on overall employment. Matt Wampler is a co-founder of an AI-powered small business called ClearCOGS. He’s been a “restaurant guy” his whole career, he told me. Restaurants and grocery stores, he says, tend to run on thin margins, yet still tend to waste a considerable amount of food. People order more spaghetti than burgers; buns get thrown out. “Restaurants just lag behind on technology,” he told me. “They’re all about people. It’s people serving people; it’s people managing people. And in that very human-centric world, the default way of handling problems is to hand it to a person. &lt;i&gt;Phil’s going to do it.&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClearCOGS takes restaurants’ customer-order history, supply data, and labor data and uses AI-powered modeling to make their books leaner and more profitable. If people are starting to order more spaghetti than burgers, the system will prompt the chef or manager to buy more pasta and fewer rolls. “We put this in place in some of my cousin’s sandwich shops,” Wampler told me. “Simple answers to simple questions. The question they needed answered was, there’s an assistant manager on the night shift and a couple hours before close, he has to decide whether to bake another tray of bread or not. We provide that answer.” This use of ChatGPT isn’t eliminating human jobs, really; neighborhood sandwich joints aren’t hiring McKinsey consultants. But it might make food service more efficient as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it doesn’t boost the economy, AI could still change the texture of our lives and alter how we spend our time, like social media did before it. Video games might become more immersive. Shops might have far better copywriting and sales visuals. Movies might look cooler. Videos in the depths of YouTube might become far weirder and more beautiful. We might also see far more formulaic content than we already do. (Much more ominously, there might be a huge amount of plausible-seeming disinformation online.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For workers, Autor noted, the great risk is that AI technologies cause too sudden a change in what kind of labor employers want. Certain specializations might get wiped out, leaving thousands of call-center operators or marketing workers unemployed. But he stressed the benefits of having such technology in our hands. Productivity has languished for decades. Machines doing a little more work would have a big upside, after all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Annie Lowrey</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/annie-lowrey/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/N_Nrq2EjopBwMg9O_h4Y59f4gDI=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/AI_jobs-1/original.jpg"><media:credit>Michael Brennan; Getty; The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">How ChatGPT Will Destabilize White-Collar Work</title><published>2023-01-20T06:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T06:54:20-05:00</updated><summary type="html">No technology in modern memory has caused mass job loss among highly educated workers.

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The longest study on human happiness found the key to a good life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/01/long-covid-prevention-pills-paxlovid-metformin/672763/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Trying to stop long COVID before it even starts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative Polarization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, police in New Mexico &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/18/us/solomon-pena-arrested-new-mexico-shootings-wednesday/index.html"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; Solomon Peña, a Republican who, after losing a race for state representative last fall, allegedly paid four men to participate in at least two shootings at the homes of Democratic state officials in Albuquerque. Peña has blamed his loss on election fraud, and police believe the attacks were politically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I called the &lt;i&gt;Atlantic &lt;/i&gt;staff writer David Graham, who &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/political-assassination-wisconsin-judge/661192/?utm_source=feed"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last summer on the killing of a retired judge in Wisconsin, to discuss the political violence that appears to be on the rise in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel Fattal:&lt;/b&gt; In your article about the assassination of the retired judge, you &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/political-assassination-wisconsin-judge/661192/?utm_source=feed"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that, based on the limited research that exists, the U.S. is showing warning signs of a rise in political violence. What are those signs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Graham:&lt;/b&gt; There are a few. One is we just have a really polarized country, and in particular, we have what political scientists call &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/us-democracy-prevent-polarization-violence-democrats-republicans/671780/?utm_source=feed"&gt;“negative polarization” or “affective polarization,”&lt;/a&gt; where people are driven almost more by their dislike of the other party than they are by any kind of shared value among their own party. And you see attitudes of a kind of dehumanization—seeing the other side as less than human, as a threat to democracy. All of these things encourage folks to take up violence; they make them believe that violence might be justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you have these risk factors. And then we see lots of political violence, even though it’s not always on the level of assassination. The most obvious case is January 6. We have seen some attempted assassinations. We had a shooting at the practice for a congressional baseball game in 2017, in which Republican Representative Steve Scalise and others were injured, and we had the Trump-supporting pipe bomber in 2018. We had a guy who tried to attack an FBI office in Cincinnati and was then killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel: &lt;/b&gt;What was your reaction to this New Mexico case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David: &lt;/b&gt;It’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;interesting to compare it with the Wisconsin case. One thing that’s good about this is no one was killed or seriously injured, which is a major difference. But in other ways, as part of the trend, I think it’s almost a bit more concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin case, from what we know, is somebody who had a personal vendetta against this judge because of a case where the judge ruled against him. People are always going to have that sort of disagreement, and what we don’t want is a situation where political violence is normalized so they think violence is a good way to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Albuquerque, we have somebody who was specifically complaining about elections being stolen; who described himself as the “&lt;a href="https://time.com/6247844/new-mexico-shootings-targeting-democrats/"&gt;MAGA King,&lt;/a&gt;” according to postings online; and who seemed to be really motivated by the sorts of things we hear people talking about in regular discourse about “stolen” elections. So you can see how it connects to things we hear every day and then takes on this really dangerous form. In that sense, I think the outcome is less grave—but we need to be more worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel:&lt;/b&gt; Solomon Peña, the alleged perpetrator in New Mexico, didn’t act alone—he involved other people in the shootings. What does that say more broadly about political violence right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David:&lt;/b&gt; I think the organization is alarming. On January 6, we could see some coordination among groups, but it’s unclear how coordinated it was. And you wonder, if these people had had their act together more, what might have happened? Could Mike Pence or Nancy Pelosi have been harmed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing applies here. This guy was allegedly able to get some people to go shoot at these folks’ houses for him. It seems, from what we know now, that they’re kind of small-time criminals, so it’s not like this was a mass political movement. But it’s worrying that someone was able to enlist people. You wonder how big it gets when it goes beyond a single actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel: &lt;/b&gt;What relevance, if any, do you think the recent convictions in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer have to this trend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David:&lt;/b&gt; I think it’s a little ambiguous. It’s obviously important that people who commit crimes like this are caught and prosecuted and punished for it. The discourse around the Whitmer case is weird, because on the one hand, you have folks getting some pretty stiff sentences, and on the other hand, you have a critique—and this is not just on the right, you hear this from folks on the more civil-libertarian left too—saying, &lt;i&gt;Is this a real plot, or is this something the FBI cooked up?&lt;/i&gt; Because we’ve seen cases where the FBI takes people who are prone to violence and helps get them going. You have an argument among some people that this plot was really deep-state puppeteering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in that case, although you have a deterrent effect, you also may end up with people distrusting the government more and being angrier about things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabel: &lt;/b&gt;There’s obviously no easy answer to this, but what can be done to stem this violence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David: &lt;/b&gt;The short answer is it’s really complicated. One thing we do know is that leaders make a difference, and when leaders are condoning or even encouraging violence, that is likely to produce more violence. When leaders say it’s unacceptable, even in the service of their cause, that will tamp it down. That’s not all of the answer, but it’s one simple answer that we do have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing Drains You Like Mixed Emotions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By Arthur Brooks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ōdī et amō,” the Roman poet Catullus wrote of his lover Lesbia about 2,000 years ago. “I hate and I love. Why I do this, perhaps you ask. I know not, but I feel it happening and I am tortured.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can relate. If you’ve ever had mixed feelings about someone you love, you know the intense discomfort that results. If your feelings were purely positive, of course, the relationship would be bliss. Even purely negative feelings would be better, because the course of action would be clear: Say goodbye. But mixed feelings leave you confused about the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

His wife began transcribing his words. Later, his son took over. These dispatches, anywhere from five to 20 tweets a day, given a title and later compiled as a Substack entry, have become an international phenomenon, written up in newspapers around the globe. Well-wishers—mostly strangers—reply, thanking him, encouraging him, commiserating, offering advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve read communiqués from the sickbed before, but Kureishi, best known for his post-colonial, sexually multifarious, comic, and deeply cool screenplays (&lt;i&gt;My Beautiful Laundrette&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid&lt;/i&gt;) and novels (&lt;i&gt;The Buddha of Suburbia&lt;/i&gt;), as well as his bad-boy persona, brings a new urgency to the exercise. Several things explain the immediacy. One, the medium he is using, Twitter, is designed to make every utterance feel like a call for an ambulance. Two, he actually is dealing with a life-or-death situation: Either he recovers or he doesn’t, and his tweets seem to have something to do with the outcome. Three, catastrophe has given Kureishi a new topic and a new voice, richer than ever in its humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re watching a bravura performance that is no performance at all. An immobilized, aging writer is processing in real time a traumatic present while gathering up his past in the face of God knows what future. The point is to piece together &lt;i&gt;something—&lt;/i&gt;a memoir, a journal, a lifeline—jaunty enough to sound like him, to assert that he, who is himself, is still &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;, a writer, not a vegetable, able to communicate and pursue his vocation. Affirmation of self, connection to readers, survival: His bulletins express the most primal purposes of literature. As he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1612863484781547520?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;tells his followers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day when I dictate these thoughts, I open what is left of my broken body in order to try and reach you, to stop myself from dying inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are keeping me alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope it doesn’t sound callous to say that Kureishi is being revitalized by disaster. I don’t think he’d mind. His son and collaborator, Carlo Kureishi, implied as much in an interview this week with Times Radio. His father, he says, is writing “more than he’s written in years now. He’s writing almost a thousand words a day, which is incredible, considering his condition. And he’s really got a subject now … which is always what a writer needs.” Or, as Kureishi &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1612472789218525185?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, lying “completely inert and silent in a drab room, without much distraction, is certainly good for creativity. Deprived of newspapers and music, you will find yourself becoming very imaginative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broken up into flowing, haiku-esque tweets, his posts sound spontaneous, but Kureishi plots them carefully. Carlo describes his father asking him, “What are we doing next?” and “In three months time, what do we want to produce?” and talking about his philosophy of writing: “How do you make it interesting; how do you tell that story?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/11/twitter-elon-musk-writers-book-publishing/672157/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What will writers do without Twitter?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I don’t think I’m wrong to perceive intentionality and form. In the first thread, from January 6, he brings us up to speed: “I cannot scratch my nose, make a phone call or feed myself. As you can imagine, this is both humiliating, degrading and a burden for others. I’ve had an operation on my spine and have shown minor improvements in the last few days.” The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1611772994921156608?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;next entry&lt;/a&gt;, January 7, “Enema,” begins his review of his life as a writer. One day, his father bought a new typewriter, and Kureishi learned to type by blindfolding himself with a tie; later, he copied out passages from &lt;i&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/i&gt;. This led him to his calling. An interruption: “Excuse me for a moment, I must have an enema now.” On January 8, in “Dead Fingers Talking, Talking,” he describes his former writing routine and its accompanying material objects, bottles of different-colored ink and “good thick paper” on which his characters take shape. Another interruption: “Excuse me, I’m being injected in my belly with something called a ‘Heparina.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1613268367003222016?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;January 11&lt;/a&gt;, in “The Door Opens,” Kureishi is cheerfully gossiping about the imperious theater agent Peggy Ramsay (she discovered the playwright Joe Orton and is featured in Orton’s biopic &lt;i&gt;Prick Up Your Ears&lt;/i&gt;), whom he met while still on the way up. Kureishi gave her a manuscript of his to read; she got strawberry jam on it and told him contemptuously that it “looked a little short”; later, she developed dementia, and when her office burned down, she blamed it on him. He wants to get across what life is like for writers, “living creatures in the world” who struggle like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But also: Let us not forget where we are. He worked out that tweet while his head was stuck all night between his bed and the wall and he couldn’t pull it out. You make what you can of what you are given. As he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1612863441299017738?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere, “This is how I write these days; I fling a net over more or less random thoughts, draw it in and hope some kind of pattern emerges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kureishi’s prospects don’t always seem bleak. Physiotherapists hoist him into a wheelchair and suddenly, he sees the sky for the first time in weeks: “some trees and a cloud and few birds. For the first time I believed that things might begin to improve.” He appears to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1615411632661794839?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;making progress&lt;/a&gt;: “I work in the gym with the physio”—the physical therapist—“for an hour or so and I feel different parts of my body starting to respond. This has been the best day so far.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deprived of his body, he&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1612863458072039444?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt; takes pleasure in his physiotherapists’&lt;/a&gt;: “I have become a big admirer of Italian men. I find them very handsome. Their skin is smooth and it glows. Their sharp dark body hair is inspiring. They are neither macho nor mummy’s boys.” He is curious about the people who work in the hospital, their lives, their opinions. “I’ve had many intimate conversations with young queer and non-binary staff members,” Kureishi wrote. “They are afraid for the future of Italy, which as you know has the misfortune of being governed by a fascist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His main objective, though, is to whistle past the graveyard. The enema prompts the memory of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1611776337211019266?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;an exam&lt;/a&gt; he had a few years earlier under the auspices of the National Health Service: A nurse inserted a finger into his “back side” and asked how long it took him to write &lt;i&gt;Midnight’s Children&lt;/i&gt;—the great breakthrough novel of Britain’s &lt;i&gt;other &lt;/i&gt;South Asian literary celebrity, Salman Rushdie. “I replied, ‘If I had indeed written Midnight’s Children, don’t you think I would have gone private?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;let us not forget where we are&lt;/i&gt;. You can make paralysis funny, but it’s not. His &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1612863491966210077?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;sign-offs&lt;/a&gt; are fond but desperate, and wryly repeat the phrase “in these shitty times,” as in, “Stay with me friends, don’t let me go. In these shitty times, your loving cripple, Hanif.” He can be pissy. He doesn’t always get along with his wife, who sits with him all day long. “She was looking tired and thin, as of course she would do in the circumstance of this terrible strain,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1612110743217872896?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. “Then she turned to me and asked, ‘Would you have ever done this for me?’ I couldn’t answer. I don’t know.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kureishi’s prognosis is uncertain. His family would like to bring him home to England, but moving him is complicated. In the meantime, he clings to identity, existence, hope, and, above all, wit. As he says in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hanifkureishi/status/1612110767691632642?s=20&amp;amp;t=yNF2hgIgU56EvCXcXOM-PQ"&gt;another sign-off&lt;/a&gt;: “More tomorrow, more optimism, more jokes.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Judith Shulevitz</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/judith-shulevitz/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Ml--Jj5YULTiUtNjncz8TaoH98I=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/shulevitz_twitter/original.jpg"><media:credit>Matt Chase / The Atlantic; Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">He’s Tweeting for His Life</title><published>2023-01-19T15:07:21-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T12:26:39-05:00</updated><summary type="html">Hanif Kureishi’s tweets from his sickbed are a bravura performance that is no performance at all.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/01/hanif-kureishi-accident-twitter-diaries/672765/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672766</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every Thanksgiving weekend, once the holiday itself has passed and people are looking for things to do for the rest of the break, I get texts from friends seeking movie recommendations: &lt;i&gt;What’s worth seeing in theaters right now?&lt;/i&gt; In 2022, that query became more of a plea. &lt;i&gt;Was there &lt;/i&gt;anything&lt;i&gt; to see? Something the &lt;/i&gt;whole&lt;i&gt; family, not just rowdy teenagers, might enjoy? Anything geared toward grown-up viewers?&lt;/i&gt; And then, with an air of horror, they would realize that only two movies along those lines were out—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/12/steven-spielberg-the-fabelmans-blockbuster-legacy/672456/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Steven Spielberg’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/11/steven-spielberg-the-fabelmans-movie-review/672078/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fabelmans&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/12/glass-onion-movie-rian-johnson-interview-knives-out-sequel/672558/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Rian Johnson’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/11/glass-onion-knives-out-movie-review/672268/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Glass Onion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—but that, on one of the year’s busiest weeks for multiplexes, neither was in wide release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year was, on the whole, a positive one for the movie-theater industry, a period of further improvement as the world continued to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/market/"&gt;movie theaters sold&lt;/a&gt; roughly 216 million tickets; in 2021, that number rose to 492 million, and last year, it shot up to 813 million. Although that’s still below the 2019 number of 1.2 billion tickets, we’re seeing an unmistakably positive trend line. The success of releases such as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/05/top-gun-maverick-review-tom-cruise/643112/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, superhero blockbusters, non-sequels, and original films&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;was galvanizing, calming fears that theaters would never rebound amid a rise in streaming options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then I watched Hollywood have one of the strangest autumns imaginable, a mostly self-inflicted series of wounds that led to speculation that the movie market for adults was &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/box-office-2023-prediction-1235205995/"&gt;in trouble&lt;/a&gt;. The most egregious move was perhaps Universal’s decision to not give a wide theatrical release to &lt;i&gt;The Fabelmans&lt;/i&gt;, a new Spielberg film with Oscar buzz; as a result, it’s made only $14 million since its November 11 release, and the most theaters it ever played in was 1,149 (a wide release tends to hover between 3,000 and 4,000). This is far short of the usual net cast by one of the most enduring names in filmmaking, and it underlines the total lack of confidence studios have had in grown-up fare of late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution, now that 2023 is upon us, is simple: Put new releases exclusively in theaters and give them a real chance to succeed with paying moviegoers. No more muddled hybrid releases, no slow and modest rollouts, and certainly nothing like Netflix’s baffling compromise with &lt;i&gt;Glass Onion&lt;/i&gt;, which played on 696 screens for just a week around Thanksgiving and then vanished until it debuted online in time for Christmas. There will be failures, yes, but Hollywood must finally recognize that the overall health of theatrical exhibition is of paramount concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/12/best-movies-2022-tar-nope-the-fabelmans/672387/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The 10 best films of 2022&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the pandemic, many studios have pivoted to streaming both as part of a mad scramble to catch up to Netflix and as a way to get more eyeballs on their own projects during an unsettled moment. But for movies, there doesn’t appear to be much profit in the current approach—HBO Max is&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/19/1118344173/hbo-max-cuts-shows"&gt; cutting back its film and TV offerings&lt;/a&gt; after a bold 2021 strategy put movies online the same day they debuted in theaters, a tactic it&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warnermedias-project-popcorn-box-office-hbo-max-experiment-gets-mixed-results-1235037096/"&gt; swerved away from&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. Disney recently saw its &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/11/bob-iger-returns-disney-ceo-bob-chapek/672221/?utm_source=feed"&gt;former CEO Bob Iger return&lt;/a&gt; to his post, replacing his successor, Bob Chapek, partly over concerns that its streamer, Disney+, had lost &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/08/business/media/disney-earnings.html"&gt;$1.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in a financial quarter. One of the biggest movie success stories of the year, &lt;i&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/i&gt;, took &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2022/11/top-gun-maverick-paramount-plus-streaming-date-1235179876/"&gt;seven months&lt;/a&gt; to arrive on its studio’s streamer (Paramount+), which didn’t stop it from immediately becoming the service’s &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/top-gun-maverick-paramount-most-watched-movie-1235475140/"&gt;No. 1 offering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix, of course, stands apart from all of this—its approach has always emphasized direct-to-streaming releases, and its massive customer base generates more revenue than its fledgling rivals do. But even Netflix is continuing to tweak its strategy in the face of &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/20/netflix-plunges-trading-subscriber-loss.html"&gt;plateauing subscribership&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/07/netflix-subscribers-stock-prices-big-studio-movies/670517/?utm_source=feed"&gt;fewer and bigger&lt;/a&gt; projects. The company is committed to online exclusivity even if that means leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table: &lt;i&gt;Glass Onion&lt;/i&gt; grossed about $15 million in one week of limited theatrical release and likely could have tripled that if it had gone wide, making it one of the year’s bigger hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So although I don’t envision a sea change at Netflix, other studios shouldn’t fear the exclusive theatrical “window,” which used to last for months but has shrunk or been abandoned altogether in the COVID era. Audiences have no consistent notion of when a movie will be available online, but the answer is often between “immediately” and “quickly.” So many of this year’s fall awards favorites—&lt;i&gt;The Fabelmans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/tar-movie-review-cate-blanchett/671665/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tár&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/banshees-of-inisherin-2022-movie-review/671801/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The Banshees of Inisherin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;—expanded to only about 1,000 screens at most, and were put online by December. All would have benefited from more time in cinemas and could have been scheduled to expand wide now, ahead of Oscar nominations being announced next week. Instead, they’re already available to purchase on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is that multiplexes feel starved of choices as big blockbusters such as &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/11/black-panther-2-wakanda-forever-movie-review/672036/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/12/avatar-2-way-of-water-movie-review-james-cameron/672448/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Avatar: The Way of Water&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dominate screens. This Christmas, the only new family film in wide release was &lt;i&gt;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&lt;/i&gt;, a long-delayed animated sequel; it has thrived and made $113 million domestically, a huge improvement on its weak $12 million opening. &lt;i&gt;Avatar &lt;/i&gt;has done tremendously well, but more heartening is the surprising success of the few other options available. The horror-comedy &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/01/m3gan-horror-movie-review/672672/?utm_source=feed"&gt;M3GAN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;has consistently outperformed the expectations of its early January release, and the family drama &lt;i&gt;A Man Called Otto&lt;/i&gt;, starring Tom Hanks, has done the same, resonating with viewers &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2023/01/a-man-called-otto-box-office-success-tom-hanks-1235223501/"&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; New York and Los Angeles (traditionally the country’s two strongest markets).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this should be the encouragement studios need to return to more traditional release strategies. The alternative is a frightening one for anything not made on the biggest scale: a world where seeing movies in theaters becomes a boutique option in only the biggest cities, and where streaming deals are the only way to fund non-blockbuster projects. This would be immensely damaging to the art form and to the diversity of projects on offer for audiences, and it’s a path Hollywood can reject by putting its faith back in cinemas—and in the viewers who love going to them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Sims</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-sims/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/dhkuff3LYTcmunWZJ_oJLjau2ps=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/movie_theatre/original.jpg"><media:credit>Murray Garrett / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Hollywood Cannot Survive Without Movie Theaters</title><published>2023-01-19T14:03:03-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-19T15:16:45-05:00</updated><summary type="html">Why is this so hard for studios to believe?</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/01/movie-theaters-streaming-film-industry-the-fabelmans/672766/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672761</id><content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;I&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;n a normal year,&lt;/span&gt; the March for Life would begin somewhere along the National Mall.

Tomorrow’s march will be the first without &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; on the books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/01/march-for-life-abortion-protest/621349/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The anti-abortion movement’s Gen-Z victors&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recognition of that fact, the march has a new route. It will finish somewhere on First Street, between the Capitol and the Court building, an acknowledgment of the enormous and somewhat nebulous task ahead: banning or restricting abortion in all 50 states. That task will involve not only Congress, the courts, and the president but also 50 individual state legislatures, thousands of lawmakers, and all of the American communities they represent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the march, activists and other attendees will be jubilant. Speakers will congratulate their fellow marchers on a job well done. Yet at the same time, a current of uncertainty ripples beneath the surface of the anti-abortion movement. Advocates are technically closer than ever to ending abortion in America, but in some ways, the path forward is more treacherous now than it was before. The movement is not in disarray, exactly, but its energy is newly decentralized, diffused throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a much more choose-your-own-adventure feel” to the movement now, Mary Ziegler, a University of California, Davis School of Law professor who has &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/mary-ziegler/?utm_source=feed"&gt;written about abortion&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overturning &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; was only the first step. The next isn’t exactly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;ince the 1980s,&lt;/span&gt; rescinding the Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling in &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt;, which established a nationwide right to abortion, had been the movement’s top goal, because it was the key that unlocked everything else. There could be no real prohibitions on abortion as long as &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; was in effect. Charging into battle was easier under a single banner, with resources and energy directed toward a single national project: filling the Supreme Court with abortion foes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, though, across all 50 states, different leaders are pressing for abortion restrictions of varying types and degrees: heartbeat bans, gestational limits, restrictions on the abortion pill, or outright bans with few or no exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America’s anti-abortion movement has always been a rich tapestry. Although its members share an overarching goal—ending abortion—they have disagreed on tactics and approach. Some groups—including Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Americans United for Life (AUL), and the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC)—have prioritized legal and political strategies; others, including many Catholic organizations, have advocated more for funding the country’s 2,700 pregnancy centers or expanding the social safety net. But there was always a power hierarchy among these groups. “If you were wondering where the bills came from, the lawsuits, it was obvious: A handful of national groups dictated everything,” Ziegler said. The NRLC and AUL organized the troops and drafted model legislation. They planned judicial strategy and pushed court cases forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the post-&lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; world, those groups are less powerful and less relevant. The central players now are the thousands of state-level politicians, local leaders, and grassroots activists who are writing and passing legislation, often independent of those once-dominant national groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/roe-v-wade-overturn-abortion-rights/629366/?utm_source=feed"&gt;From the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post-Roe America&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influence of the national groups &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/us/anti-abortion-laws.html"&gt;has been waning&lt;/a&gt; since even before the fall of &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/meet-the-legal-strategist-behind-the-texas-abortion-ban/"&gt;A Texas pastor and a former state solicitor general&lt;/a&gt;, for example, came up with Texas’s 2021 S.B. 8, which banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat was detectable (typically after six weeks) and authorized private citizens to sue abortion providers. The two men did so without much input from any national group, according to the experts I spoke with. Abortion restrictions in &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/alabama-anti-abortion-bill-drafted-by-unelected-activist-eric-johnston-2019-5" target="_blank"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and Georgia, which passed in 2019 and went into effect in 2022, were drafted by different state activists and leaders and contain starkly different language, showing little influence from national groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national anti-abortion movement clearly wasn’t ready for this flurry of activity. But it could have been better prepared, Daniel K. Williams, a history professor at the University of West Georgia, told me. When Amy Coney Barrett was nominated to the Court, or even as soon as Trump was elected president, national organizations could have put forward a single model law for lawmakers, and uniform guidance for health-care providers and hospitals. Instead, America ended up with a chaotic patchwork of abortion restrictions—a mixture of newly written trigger laws and dusty legislation from the late 19th century. Some of these new policies are vague or fail to address health complications such as miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. They propose varying consequences for abortion providers and different mechanisms for enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, the AUL released its American Life Initiative and its model legislation, the Ready for Life Act, which bans abortion after conception and includes a life-of-the-mother exception, as well as clarifications regarding miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. But it came five months after the &lt;em&gt;Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization&lt;/em&gt; decision overturning &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt;. That groups were drafting these guidelines “months after &lt;em&gt;Dobbs&lt;/em&gt; and not experiencing any uniformity in state legislatures is a sign of how decentralized and swift-moving all of this has been,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarke Forsythe, the senior counsel for AUL, defends his organization’s strategy: “We needed time to analyze &lt;em&gt;Dobbs&lt;/em&gt; and its impact and implications and needed time to put the package together,” he told me. “It’s a long-term initiative and a long-term vision. There was no need to get it out before the election.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion opponents insist that a state-level free-for-all could turn out to be helpful for the movement. With more people involved and working toward different initiatives, the argument goes, activists might come up with innovative ideas and policy proposals. Democracy, by nature, is messy. “It’s good for the country and good for our politics to decentralize the issue,” Forsythe told me. “The Court sent it back to the local level, where public policy can be better aligned with public opinion, where the people responsible for it are responsive to people at the local level.” Decentralization is the movement’s strength, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/lila-rose-anti-abortion/593404/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Lila Rose&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the national anti-abortion group Live Action, told me. “It requires a diverse and multifaceted approach. It’s not strategic conflict so much as strategic differences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular moment gives anti-abortion activists a chance to think creatively and to forge new alliances, some in the movement argue. Now that &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; is gone, do they need to keep up their ties with the GOP? “I would like to see the movement disentangle itself from particular political parties,” Erika Bachiochi, an anti-abortion writer and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, told me. Maybe, she added, there’s room for a return of the “old pro-life Democrat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an unintended consequence of overturning &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; could be that the movement has inadvertently pushed its highest objective—ending legal abortion—further out of reach. “On the one hand, when there’s a free-for-all, ideas that may never have been given the time of day can emerge and work,” Ziegler said. “On the other, you can have bills that are damaging nationally get passed.” Texas’s S.B. 8—the Texas Heartbeat Act—frustrated some movement leaders because it empowered individual citizens to sue, which meant that those individuals would control the narrative, Ziegler said. Others worry about the vocal “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/abortion-abolitionists.html"&gt;abortion abolition” groups&lt;/a&gt;, which have been calling for women who obtain abortions to be punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, Ziegler says, “there’s no single voice in the movement to say, ‘No, that’s not what we stand for.’” A few extremists, in other words, could damage the movement’s reputation—and interfere with its ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;B&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;efore &lt;em&gt;Dobbs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;anti-abortion advocates &lt;a href="https://www.governing.com/news/headlines/a-pro-life-strategy-for-the-country-built-in-the-states.html"&gt;seemed&lt;/a&gt; confident that once a handful of states banned abortion, many more would follow—that they could &lt;a href="https://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/moving-toward-a-culture-of-life"&gt;build a “culture of life”&lt;/a&gt; in America that would put the country on a righteous path. In some ways, the opposite has occurred. As a few states put limits on abortion rights, others, such as Vermont, California, and Michigan, have reacted by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-abortion.html"&gt;enshrining&lt;/a&gt; those rights into state law. Meanwhile, voters in red states including Kansas, Montana, and Kentucky &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-abortion.html"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; attempts to restrict abortion. Former President Donald Trump—the man whose nomination of three Supreme Court justices led directly to the overturning of &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt;—has gone so far as to blame Republicans’ disappointing midterm performance on the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/03/donald-trump-abortion-midterms-republicans"&gt;anti-abortion movement&lt;/a&gt;. (In response, Rose &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilaGraceRose/status/1610724855472881669"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; his comments “sniveling cowardice.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the movement’s relationship with the Republican Party is troubled. Last fall, when Senator Lindsey Graham proposed legislation restricting abortions after 15 weeks, only a handful of his Republican colleagues were publicly supportive. "Most of the members of my conference prefer that this be dealt with at the state level," Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/abortion-roe-prolife-movement-prohibition/661402/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Frum: Roe is the new prohibition&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the new Congress, where Republicans have a House majority, one of the first pieces of legislation passed in the lower chamber was the so-called Born Alive bill, which would require health-care providers to treat babies in the vanishingly rare cases of failed abortions. Here was a chance for Republicans to pass a bill restricting abortion after 15 weeks or even six, in a show of support to the movement that they purport to champion. But they didn’t. Republicans in Congress are “afraid to do anything on this issue that’s meaningful” for fear of the political consequences, Ziegler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-abortion leaders like Rose believe that they’re being unfairly blamed for these recent Republican losses and missed opportunities. They argue that in the midterms the GOP chose candidates who were insufficiently anti-abortion, or simply problematic, such as Mehmet Oz and Herschel Walker. But there was also a communication issue, they say. Candidates weren’t outspoken &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; about abortion; they should have talked more about the Democrats’ support for abortion at late gestational ages, and their plan to codify abortion rights into law. “That’s where the real problem was” in the midterms, Marilyn Musgrave, the vice president of government affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told me. “Republicans weren’t pointing out the extremism on the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that some Republicans campaigned successfully on abortion restrictions last year, including GOP Governors Ron DeSantis of Florida, Kay Ivey of Alabama, Brian Kemp of Georgia, and Greg Abbott of Texas, each of whom won reelection by a substantial margin. Still, the recent state referenda and post-&lt;em&gt;Dobbs&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/support-for-legalized-abortion-grows-since-dobbs-ruling-wsj-poll-shows-11662210020"&gt;polling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/06/majority-of-public-disapproves-of-supreme-courts-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the anti-abortion movement is too optimistic about the level of support for their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve clearly lost the narrative,” Charlie Camosy, an ethics professor at Creighton University School of Medicine and a columnist for the &lt;em&gt;Religion News Service&lt;/em&gt;, told me. Activists like Camosy hope that the movement’s new emphasis will be a grassroots effort to educate Americans and persuade them to oppose abortion. Camosy isn’t attending the March for Life tomorrow; instead, he’s giving a speech at a Catholic seminar in Freehold, New Jersey, where he lives. “Something is wrong in our ability to communicate what’s at stake,” he said of the broader movement. “Focusing on the national level distracts from getting Michigan or Montana or Kentucky or Kansas right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eventually, Camosy’s movement will have to face the reality of abortion in America: Some states just aren’t going to budge. “Fewer than 50 percent of states are likely to meaningfully curtail abortion,” Williams estimates. Even if the movement gains ground in some states, “that’s likely only to harden the resistance in more strongly pro-choice states.” Which means that, rather than a growing national consensus on abortion, Americans probably can expect more polarization—a cultural standoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow’s March for Life will be the first time activists have held a major national gathering since &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; was overturned in June. But it will probably be a much smaller event than before. Some activists have wondered whether it should happen at all. More states and cities will be hosting their own rallies, because that’s where the next round of work needs to be done. And many people will be at those local marches instead—to start, or maybe to double down, on their difficult project of creating a “culture of life.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elaine Godfrey</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/elaine-godfrey/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6FnX0a_Tr7CFzTTtGKsnkFPic8I=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/march_for_life/original.jpg"><media:credit>Brendan Hoffman / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">What Winning Did to the Anti-abortion Movement</title><published>2023-01-19T13:56:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T09:12:22-05:00</updated><summary type="html">As protesters prepare for this year’s March for Life, a current of uncertainty ripples beneath the surface.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/march-for-life-anti-abortion-movement-after-roe/672761/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672764</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The year after a midterm election is presidential purgatory. Congressional investigators from the opposing party devote themselves to flaying the incumbent. Stripped of any possibility of grand legislative accomplishments, presidents busy themselves with foreign policy and patiently wait for their domestic foes to overplay their hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Joe Biden, this is all intimately familiar. He experienced this discomfort as Barack Obama’s vice president. And he walked away with a sense of how he might get through it differently himself, how he could profitably survive this awkward year—and leverage it as the basis for reelection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, Obama anointed Biden “The Sheriff.” Obama charged him with overseeing the implementation of the Recovery Act, the $787 billion economic stimulus, passed in the first days of the new administration. This was a thankless task, because it made Biden responsible for any waste, fraud, and abuse in the program, but it was also a dream assignment. The career politician had a chance to race from ribbon cutting to ribbon cutting. He could bask in selling governmental achievements made of concrete and steel, stuff people could touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden’s frustration with Obama was that he didn’t sufficiently consider the marketing potential of the stimulus. Obama frankly admitted that he took “perverse pride” in how his technocratic administration constructed policy without regard for political considerations. The 2009 Recovery Act included tax cuts, but intentionally didn’t advertise them. The government quietly withheld less money from paychecks, a dividend that almost nobody noticed. This furtive tax cut was theoretically effective, because consumers were less likely to save money that they didn’t know they possessed. But it was also a political nonfact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/?utm_source=feed"&gt;From the April 2016 issue: The Obama doctrine&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This humility of sorts transgressed a core Biden maxim: Good policy is useless without good politics. The health of the government (not to mention the health of the Democratic Party) depends almost entirely on public appreciation of the government’s deeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that he’s president, Biden is his own self-anointed Sheriff. In its first two years, his administration passed ambitious, expensive legislation. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act spends $1 trillion. The CHIPS and Science Act devotes more than $250 billion to jump-starting the American semiconductor industry and investing in technological research. The Inflation Reduction Act contains, at least, a $370 billion investment in clean energy. Biden could break his hand signing all the checks that his administration is about to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overseeing these investments will allow Biden to fulfill the two grandest ambitions of his presidency. The first ambition is both lofty and self-interested. He has long argued that democracy will prevail in its struggle against authoritarianism only if it can demonstrate its competence to the world. That means passing legislation. But he believes that non-college-educated voters, the neglected constituents he wants to take back from the Republicans, hardly know about the big bills emanating from Washington with banal names. And they won’t believe in their efficacy in any case, unless they can see the fruits of the legislation with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden intends to deluge this group with relentless salesmanship—christening new airports and standing next to local officials as they break ground on new factories and tunnels. When he daydreams in the Oval Office, he imagines omnipresent road signs announcing new government projects in his name. In his mind, there will be Biden Rest Stops as far as the eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His second ambition is far trickier. He doesn’t just imagine scattered projects. He wants to comprehensively change the economy of entire regions of the country. By geographically concentrating investments—in broadband, airports, semiconductor plants, universities—he can transform depressed remnants of the Rust Belt into the next iteration of North Carolina’s Research Triangle. By seizing the commanding heights of the industries of the future, he can reindustrialize America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that vision requires mobilizing sclerotic bureaucracies—and aligning disparate agencies that don’t normally play nice with one another. The word &lt;em&gt;implementation&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps the least sexy word in the English language, is his current fixation. He believes that the latent potential of these projects can be realized only if he pays close attention to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large checks to semiconductor manufacturers will bring jobs and protect the supply chain from foreign threats. But that’s only half the mission. With his purse strings comes power. And Biden wants to use his leverage to create high-paying unionized jobs. He intends to pressure CEOs so that they don’t furtively funnel government money into stock buybacks. Even though the public doesn’t have this impression of Biden, he actually gravitates to the weeds. Obsessing over small details allows him to feel a sense of mastery of big processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Biden realizes that these projects will be mere sideshows in the press, as he spars with adversaries, foreign and domestic, bent on provoking apocalypse. But, in his mind, the role of Sheriff is connected to solving congressional crises, perhaps not in the near term but over time. All along, Biden has believed that he can exploit fissures within the Republican Party. That’s why he has always carefully drawn a distinction between the authoritarian MAGA faction and the traditional conservatives, whom he recognizes as his fellow politicians. There’s no dealing with the MAGA set. But the other Republicans have conventional interests, which he can exploit in his search for a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/11/biden-2022-midterms-policy-record-approval/671941/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What Joe Biden has (and hasn’t) accomplished&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took this approach on January 4, in his appearance with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Brent Spence Bridge, crossing the Ohio River, to celebrate new government investment. That event transpired as Kevin McCarthy flailed in his campaign to become House speaker. Biden knows that McConnell has little regard for McCarthy—and would rather cut a deal on the debt ceiling than crash the U.S. economy. (After all, McConnell cut that deal before, back in 2011.) McConnell could serve as an ally while Biden slowly cultivates relationships with the 18 Republican House members from districts that he won in 2020. If these Republicans have any prayer of winning reelection, they will need to evince some measure of independence from the Trumpists. They, too, will need to show their constitutents that they can govern. Biden is not confident that he will prevail in this quest, but it’s his best play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of Republican extremism, Biden will continue to periodically sound the alarm about the threat to democracy. But he also knows that his opponents will do most of this work for him—and that the Sheriff can’t just pose as the protector; he also needs to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Franklin Foer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/franklin-foer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/9HzGWKsbWy1EDJZ1X3gFpXFKsvk=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/biden_theory_of_the_case/original.jpg"><media:credit>Drew Angerer / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">How Joe Biden Wins Again</title><published>2023-01-19T12:53:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-19T14:54:07-05:00</updated><summary type="html">Biden Rest Stops as far as the eye can see</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/biden-economic-priorities-non-college-educated-voters-industrialize-america/672764/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672763</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three years into the global fight against SARS-CoV-2, the arsenal to combat long COVID remains depressingly bare. Being vaccinated seems to reduce people’s chances of developing the condition, but the only surefire option for avoiding long COVID is to avoid catching the coronavirus &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;—a proposition that feels ever more &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/05/covid-reinfection-research-immunity/639436/?utm_source=feed"&gt;improbable&lt;/a&gt;. For anyone who is newly infected, “we don’t have any interventions that are known to work,” says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist and long-COVID researcher at Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers are hopeful that the forecast might shift soon. A &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.21.22283753v1.full.pdf"&gt;pair&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.03.22281783v1"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; preprint studies, both now under review for publication in scientific journals, hint that two long-COVID-preventing pills might already be on our pharmacy shelves: the antiviral Paxlovid and metformin, an affordable drug commonly used for treating type 2 diabetes. When taken early in infection, each seems to at least modestly trim the chance of developing long COVID—by 42 percent, in the case of metformin. Neither set of results is a slam dunk. The Paxlovid findings did not come out of a clinical trial, and were focused on patients at high risk of developing severe, acute COVID; the metformin data &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;come out of a clinical trial, but the study was small. When I called more than half a dozen infectious-disease experts to discuss them, all used hopeful, but guarded, language: The results are “promising,” “intriguing”; they “warrant further investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, though, any advance at all feels momentous. Long COVID remains the pandemic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/long-covid-risk/627031/?utm_source=feed"&gt;biggest unknown&lt;/a&gt;: Researchers still can’t even agree on its prevalence or the features that define it. What &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;clear is that millions of people in the United States alone, and countless more worldwide, have experienced some form of it, and more are expected to join them. “We’ve already seen early data, and we’ll continue to see data, that that will emphasize the impact that long COVID has on our society, on quality of life, on productivity, on our health system and medical expenditures,” says Susanna Naggie, an infectious-disease physician and COVID-drug researcher at Duke University. “This needs to be a high priority,” she told me. Researchers have to trim long COVID incidence as much as possible, as soon as possible, with whatever safe, effective options they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, news of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00823-y"&gt;inertia around preventive long-COVID therapies&lt;/a&gt; may not come as much of a shock. Interventions that stop disease from developing are, on the whole, a neglected group; big, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials—the industry gold standard—usually look to investigate potential treatments, rather than drugs that might keep future illness at bay. It’s a bias that makes research easier and faster; it’s a core part of the American medical culture’s reactive approach to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/mecfs-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-doctors-long-covid/671518/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Long COVID has forced a reckoning for one of medicine’s most neglected diseases&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long COVID, the terrain is even rougher. Researchers are best able to address prevention when they understand a disease’s triggers, the source of its symptoms, and who’s most at risk. That intel provides a road map, pointing them toward specific bodily systems and interventions. The potential causes of COVID, though, remain murky, says Adrian Hernandez, a cardiologist and clinical researcher at Duke. Years of research have shown that the condition is quite likely to comprise a cluster of diverse syndromes with different triggers and prognoses, more like a category (e.g., “cancer”) than a singular disease. If that’s the case, then a single preventive treatment shouldn’t be expected to cut its rates for everyone. Without a universal way to define and diagnose the condition, researchers can’t easily design trials, either. Endpoints such as &lt;em&gt;hospitalization &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt; tend to be binary and countable. Long COVID operates in shades of gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, some scientists might be making headway with vetted antiviral drugs, already known to slash the risk of developing severe COVID-19. A subset of long-COVID cases could be caused by bits of virus that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/05/long-covid-treatment-pfizer-paxlovid/629810/?utm_source=feed"&gt;linger in the body&lt;/a&gt;, prompting the immune system to wage an extended war; a drug that clears the microbe more quickly might lower the chances that any part of the invader sticks around. Paxlovid, which interferes with SARS-CoV-2’s ability to copy itself inside of our cells, fits that bill. “The idea here is really nipping it in the bud,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long-COVID researcher at Washington University in St. Louis, who led the recent Paxlovid work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paxlovid has yet to hit the scientific jackpot: proof from a big clinical trial that shows it can prevent long COVID in newly infected people. But Al-Aly’s study, which pored over the electronic medical records of more than 56,000 high-risk patients, offers some early optimism. People who took the pills, he and his colleagues found, were 26 percent less likely to report lingering symptoms three months after their symptoms began than those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/11/paxlovid-covid-drug-hesitancy/672210/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Inside the mind of an anti-Paxxer&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pills’ main benefit remains the prevention of severe, acute disease. (In the recent study, Paxlovid-takers were also 30 percent less likely to be hospitalized and 48 percent less likely to die.) Al-Aly expects that the drug’s effectiveness at preventing long COVID—if it’s confirmed in other populations—will be “modest, not huge.” Though the two functions could yet be linked: Some long-COVID cases may result from severe infections that damage tissues so badly that the body struggles to recover. And should Paxlovid’s potential pan out, it could help build the case for testing other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. Al-Aly and his colleagues are currently working on a similar study into molnupiravir. “The early results are encouraging,” he told me, though “not as robust as Paxlovid.” (Another study, run by other researchers, that followed hospitalized COVID patients found those who took &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34850210/"&gt;remdesivir&lt;/a&gt; were less likely to get long COVID, but a later randomized clinical trial &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33825-5"&gt;didn’t bear that out&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial testing Paxlovid’s preventive potency against long COVID is still needed. Kit Longley, a spokesperson for Pfizer, told me in an email that the company doesn’t currently have one planned, though it is “continuing to monitor data from our clinical studies and real-world evidence.” (The company is &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05576662"&gt;collaborating with a research group at Stanford&lt;/a&gt; to study Paxlovid in new clinical contexts, but they’re looking at whether the pills &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/05/long-covid-treatment-pfizer-paxlovid/629810/?utm_source=feed"&gt;might &lt;em&gt;treat &lt;/em&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt; that’s already developed. The RECOVER trial, a large NIH-funded study on long COVID, is also focusing its current studies on treatment.) But given the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/11/paxlovid-covid-drug-hesitancy/672210/?utm_source=feed"&gt;meager uptake rates&lt;/a&gt; for Paxlovid even among those in high-risk groups, Al-Aly thinks his new data could already serve a useful purpose: providing people with extra motivation to take the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case for adding metformin to the anti-COVID tool kit might be a bit muddier. The drug isn’t the most intuitive medication to deploy against a respiratory virus, and despite its widespread use among diabetics, its exact effects on the body remain nebulous, says Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. But there are many reasons to believe it might be useful. Some research has shown that metformin can mess with the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8159020/"&gt;manufacture of viral proteins&lt;/a&gt; inside of human cells, Bramante told me, which may &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9159967/"&gt;impede the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and &lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;other pathogens to reproduce&lt;/u&gt;. The drug also appears to rev up the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19095-z"&gt;disease-dueling powers&lt;/a&gt; of certain immune cells, and to stave off &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990459/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Studies have shown that metformin can improve responses to certain vaccinations in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9261392/"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7567856/"&gt;rodents&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers have found that people taking the drug seem &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9609450/"&gt;less likely to get seriously sick&lt;/a&gt; from influenza. Even the diabetes-coronavirus connection may not be so tenuous: Metabolic disease is a risk factor for severe COVID; infection itself can put &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213858722000444"&gt;blood-sugar levels on the fritz&lt;/a&gt;. It’s certainly plausible that having a metabolically altered body, Schultz-Cherry told me, could make &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac903/6957486"&gt;infections worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/05/long-covid-treatment-pfizer-paxlovid/629810/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The promising treatment we’re not even trying for long COVID&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evidence that metformin helps prevent long COVID remains sparse. Carolyn Bramante, the scientist who led the metformin study, told me that when her team first set out in 2020 to investigate the drug’s effects on SARS-CoV-2 infections in a randomized, clinical trial, long COVID wasn’t really on their radar. Like many others in their field, they were hoping to repurpose established medicines to keep infected people out of the hospital; early studies of metformin—as well as the two other drugs in their trial, the antidepressant fluvoxamine and the antiparasitic ivermectin—hinted that they’d work. Ironically, two years later, their story flipped around. A large analysis, published last summer, showed that &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2201662"&gt;none of the three drugs&lt;/a&gt; were stellar at preventing severe COVID in the short term—a disappointing result (though Bramante contends that their data still indicate that metformin does some good). Then, when Bramante and her colleagues examined their data again, they found that study participants that had taken metformin for two weeks around the start of their illness were 42 percent less likely to have a long-COVID diagnosis from their doctor nearly a year down the road. David Boulware, an infectious-disease physician who helped lead the work, considers that degree of reduction pretty decent: “Is it 100 percent? No,” he told me. “But it’s better than zero.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin may well prove to prevent long COVID but not acute, severe COVID (or vice versa). Plenty of people who never spend time in the hospital can still end up developing chronic symptoms. And Iwasaki points out that the demographics of long-haulers and people who get severe COVID don’t really overlap; the latter skew older and male. In the future, early-infection regimens may be multipronged: antivirals, partnered with metabolic drugs, in the hopes of keeping symptoms both mild and short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But researchers are still a long way off from delivering that reality. It’s not yet clear, for instance, whether the drugs work additively when combined, Boulware told me. Nor is it a given that they’ll work across different demographics—age, vaccination status, risk factors, and more. Bramante and Boulware’s study cast a decently wide net: Although everyone enrolled in the trial was overweight or obese, many were young and healthy; a few were even pregnant. The study was not enormous, though—about 1,000 people. It also relied on patients’ individual doctors to deliver long-COVID diagnoses, likely leading to some inconsistencies, so other studies that follow up in the future could find different results. For now, this isn’t enough to “mean we should run out and use metformin,” Schultz-Cherry, who has been battling long COVID herself, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications could still fill the long-COVID gaps. Hernandez, the Duke cardiologist, is hopeful that one of his ongoing clinical trials, ACTIV-6, might provide answers soon. He and his team are testing whether any of several drugs—including ivermectin, fluvoxamine, the steroid fluticasone, and, as a new addition, the anti-inflammatory montelukast—might cut down on severe, short-term COVID. But Hernandez and his colleagues, Naggie among them, appended a check-in at the 90-day mark, when they’ll be asking their patients whether they’re experiencing a dozen or so symptoms that could hint at a chronic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That check-in questionnaire won’t capture the full list of long-COVID symptoms, now &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/long-covid-over-200-symptoms-and-search-guidance"&gt;more than 200 strong&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the three-month benchmark could give them a sense of where to keep looking, and for how long. Hernandez, Naggie, and their colleagues are considering whether to extend their follow-up period to six months, maybe farther. The need for long-COVID prevention, after all, will only grow as the total infection count does. “We’re not going to get rid of long COVID anytime soon,” Iwasaki told me. “The more we can prevent onset, the better off we are.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Katherine J.

Facts lost. History lost. Marcos won.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcos’s win represented a decisive victory for authoritarianism in the Philippines. The new president is the son and namesake of the dictator and kleptocrat Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. His victory also represented a direct threat to Ressa. Marcos’s supporters are among those who, like his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, have targeted and harassed both Ressa and Rappler, the Manila-based news organization she co-founded and runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, however, Ressa is celebrating an unexpected victory of her own. A Philippine court acquitted her, and Rappler, of four charges of tax evasion—charges drummed up in “a brazen abuse of power” that was intended “to stop journalists from doing their jobs,” she told reporters who had gathered outside the courthouse after her acquittal. The charges would have carried a maximum prison sentence of 34 years if she were convicted. “Of course it was emotional,” she said, her voice breaking repeatedly. “Today, facts win. Truth wins. Justice wins.” When I spoke with Ressa shortly after the verdict, she told me she was feeling “triumphant.” Also: very tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fight is nowhere near over. Before her acquittal, Ressa had 10 criminal charges against her, all brought under the former presidential administration in quick succession, prompted by Rappler’s aggressive coverage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/11/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-journalist-attack-rappler-facebook/672072/?utm_source=feed"&gt;administration’s corruption&lt;/a&gt; during the country’s drug wars. “We kind of live in this uncertainty,” she said, referring to the remaining pending cases, which include another charge of tax evasion and her appeal of a cyberlibel conviction. (That conviction stems from a publishing decision that Rappler made &lt;a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/06/14/20/how-correcting-a-typo-got-maria-into-trouble-the-cyberlibel-case-vs-rappler"&gt;before the cyberlibel law even existed&lt;/a&gt;.) But in some ways, she told me, “we’ve been through the worst already. We survived six years of Rodrigo Duterte and we did our job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ressa’s steadfastness and devotion to that story, despite Duterte’s attempts to silence her, helped earn her the Nobel Prize in 2021. Several journalists who have spoken out against government corruption have been murdered in the Philippines, including 23 under the Duterte administration and two since Marcos took office last year. In September, the radio journalist Renato Blanco was fatally stabbed. In October, the broadcast journalist Percival Mabasa was shot dead in what police claim was a hit ordered by the country’s prisons chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Ressa says, she wants to focus all her energy on “2024, which is, I believe, the tipping point for democracy globally. As of now, 60 percent of the world is living under autocracy. We’ve rolled back to 1989.” By that, she means that the level of democracy experienced by the average person around the world has reverted to 1989 levels. The number of liberal democracies was down to 34 in 2021, the lowest it has been since 1995. Closed autocracies are on the rise. Thirty-five states now suffer from major deteriorations in freedom of expression at the hands of governments, compared with only five a decade ago. The situation is particularly bad in the Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, according to &lt;a href="https://v-dem.net/media/publications/dr_2022.pdf"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; last year by the Varieties of Democracy Institute at the University of Gothenburg, in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ressa, today’s democratic backsliding also calls to mind September 1972, when the elder Marcos declared martial law, citing a national crisis of communism and crime, and promised to build what he called “the New Society” while retaining for himself virtually unlimited presidential powers. Marcos oversaw the torture, kidnapping, and extrajudicial executions of tens of thousands of citizens. At least 50,000 people—many of them human-rights activists, journalists, labor leaders, and church workers—were arrested and detained from 1972 to 1975 alone, according to Amnesty International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;During this tumultuous time in the Philippines, Ressa was in the third grade. She had just moved from Manila to New Jersey. She was not thinking primarily about martial law. She was trying to figure out what a pajama party was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a party where everyone wears pajamas&lt;/em&gt;, her mother told her. But when she showed up to her friend Sharon’s house dressed for bed, she saw that none of the other girls was in pajamas. “I turned in panic to my mom, who sheepishly admitted she didn’t really know what a ‘pajama party’ was, either,” Ressa wrote in her autobiography. Ressa remembers how her friend shrugged it off and quickly helped her inside the house to change. Her lesson from that day: “When you take a risk, you have to trust that someone will come to your aid; and when it’s your turn, you will help someone else. It’s better to face your fear than to run from it, because running won’t make the problem go away. When you face it, you have the chance to conquer it. That was how I began to define courage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few people have had their courage tested the way Ressa has in recent years. For now, she has a to-do list with three very big priorities on it: (1) avoid prison, (2) fix the internet, and (3) save democracy. “If we don’t put any guardrails—significant guardrails—around technology, we’re jumping off the cliff,” she told me. “What’s at stake is the future of journalism and the survival of democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ressa co-founded Rappler in 2012, in part because she could see the immense potential of the web—and she was drawn to the idea of harnessing people’s snap emotional reactions for good. People like to think of the internet as a marketplace of ideas, but Ressa understood early on that its current architecture makes it first and foremost a marketplace of feelings. So while sites like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/?utm_source=feed"&gt;built algorithms&lt;/a&gt; that invisibly rewarded and prioritized posts that elicited anger, Rappler gave its readers a mood map, crowdsourcing reactions to articles and sharing the findings openly. “If you actually go through the exercise of identifying how you feel, you’re more prone to be rational,” she &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/in-the-philippines-rappler-is-trying-to-figure-out-the-role-of-emotion-in-the-news/"&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; at the time. “If you can identify how you feel, will you be more receptive to the debate that’s in front of you? I hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ressa built Rappler in a far sunnier era of web history, when people were still celebrating the Arab Spring as a success for democracy, and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/facebook-authoritarian-hostile-foreign-power/620168/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the big social platforms&lt;/a&gt; seemed like they had the potential to be positive forces. Today she puts it starkly: “Social media prioritizes the spread of lies over facts,” she told me. “Our information ecosystem, it’s corrupted right now. If your information ecosystem is corrupted, then that leads to the corruption of your institutions. And when you don’t have working institutions, you don’t have checks and balances. We’re electing illiberal leaders democratically, and they’re corrupting the institutions from within. And when the institutions are corrupted, when that happens, you lose your freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite horrific targeted harassment, death threats, and attempts by some of the most powerful men in the world to silence her, Ressa has been relentless in her belief that it does not have to be this way. She believes that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/social-media-harm-facebook-meta-response/670975/?utm_source=feed"&gt;global democratic decline&lt;/a&gt; is a temporary condition; that authoritarianism will be beaten back; that the people and the press can be free; that tyranny will be stopped. She believes all of this because, for one thing, she is basically the Energizer Bunny of Nobel Peace Prize winners, and also because she knows that any other outcome would be intolerable. “Compared to others in hiding, in exile, or in jail, I am lucky,” she wrote in her latest book. “The only defense a journalist has is to shine the light on the truth, to expose the lie—and I can still do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ressa has watched in real time as government operatives have attacked her and her news organization, attempted to discredit her and destroy her livelihood, and charged her with numerous crimes to frighten her into submission. You can see why Ressa has argued that we ought to treat this technocultural moment not as a beginning but as an ending—as the aftermath of a war. She argues for the creation of NATO-like partnerships and a new Declaration of Human Rights to protect democratic values in the age of the social web. The outcome she is after may not come to pass. The solutions she poses may not be exactly right. But what she is fighting for is most certainly worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adrienne LaFrance</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/adrienne-lafrance/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/XQ0AMerRkKh_kTRs5Dn78eUzClo=/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/maria_ressa_3/original.jpg"><media:credit>Eloisa Lopez / Reuters / Redux</media:credit><media:description>A Philippine court acquitted Maria Ressa on all four charges of tax evasion against her this week.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">The Energizer Bunny of Nobel Laureates</title><published>2023-01-19T12:06:54-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-19T17:09:35-05:00</updated><summary type="html">Maria Ressa is focused on three things: avoiding prison, fixing the entire internet, and saving democracy.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/01/maria-ressa-philippines-tax-evasion-acquittal/672760/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672762</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Live to Lead&lt;/i&gt;, a Netflix documentary series that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle produced,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;cites the legacy of Nelson Mandela as its inspiration. Because he was my grandfather, I was contacted recently by an Australian newspaper to comment on this. Call me naive, but I did not suspect that I was being recruited to a press vendetta against the royal couple; I was shocked when my remarks were misused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My statement of an obvious fact—that their struggles, my grandfather’s and Harry and Meghan’s, were hardly identical—was turned into a slight against the couple. When I voiced my annoyance at seeing Mandela’s name and legacy exploited, that too was taken to be an attack on the documentary and the couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was far from what I’d meant. In fact, I felt dumbfounded and disheartened to see my name, and my grandfather’s, used to serve a backlash against Meghan Markle, a woman of color who’d had the temerity to marry into the British Royal Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/harry-meghan-netflix-attention-apology/672581/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Caitlin Flanagan: Harry, Meghan, and the men who hate them&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it upsets me whenever the Mandela name or likeness is used for purely commercial purposes, to sell merchandise without any benefit to the family or the charitable causes he championed. And I will always criticize such cynical profiteering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not what I associate with Harry and Meghan. Indeed, I welcome the inspiration they’ve taken from my grandfather’s legacy for their social activism. I admire them for the courage of their convictions and the good causes they have espoused. Their work resonates with my grandfather’s preoccupation with justice and freedom for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It touches my heart that what my grandfather achieved decades ago still spurs people to action today, even people at the heart of the Royal Family in Britain. Madiba—Mandela’s nickname in Xhosa—is beloved as “the father of the nation” because he proved that an unfailing commitment to love, forgiveness, and reconciliation can turn the odds in favor of peace and justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandfather was scarcely dead when people started exploiting his legacy. Even at his funeral, South African officials &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42224937"&gt;misappropriated millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; earmarked for development work, spending some of it on promotional T-shirts. And so it goes: Every year in South Africa, on Nelson Mandela International Day, clubs use my grandfather’s face on flyers to bring people in. All over the world, in fact, people sell T-shirts with my grandfather’s face on them—some might call it the price of my grandfather being a global icon, but none of the profits go to support his true legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Harry’s fascination with the life of my grandfather seems not only sincere but also to go back years. Harry has spoken of meeting my grandfather late in his life, and in 2014, he founded the Invictus Games for disabled former servicemen and women. &lt;i&gt;Invictus&lt;/i&gt;, which means “unconquerable,” is also the title of a &lt;a href="https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/invictus/"&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt;, by the British poet William Ernest Henley, that my grandfather used to recite during his 27 years in the apartheid regime’s prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandela spent those years confined to a tiny cell, with no bed and no plumbing, or forced to do constant hard labor—harsh conditions designed to break his resolve. This poem, about the individual’s capacity to find strength within to overcome adversity, was a source of solace and hope to my grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/harry-meghan-netflix-show/672400/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Helen Lewis: Harry and Meghan are playing a whole different game&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the paths that my grandfather and Harry took in life were completely different, I can see how the young prince must also have found the poem a comfort for his sense of isolation within the Royal Family. That it inspired him to create the Invictus Games is a testament to the universal nature of my grandfather’s legacy—and Harry was true to that legacy in putting a sports initiative at the center of his charitable work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In apartheid South Africa, sports were heavily racialized. Rugby, in particular, was notorious because the national team, the Springboks, was all-white. We in the anti-apartheid movement saw rugby as a cultural symbol of white-minority rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, soon after the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa was to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. My grandfather, by then the country’s first Black president, saw this as an opening that no one else had recognized. To some dismay among his own supporters, Mandela threw his backing behind the Springboks and sent a message that all South Africans should support the team. This bold move broke the wall between the traditionally all-white team and South Africa’s Black communities. It proclaimed once and for all that South Africa was now the multiracial democracy that my grandfather had so long fought for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symbolism of unity was crucial in that moment, but, of course, not all of our society’s ills could be so easily resolved. Despite real progress in the decades since then, grave inequities persist. In South Africa, entrenched&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/racism-in-south-africa-why-the-anc-has-failed-to-dismantle-patterns-of-white-privilege-187660"&gt; patterns of white racism&lt;/a&gt; have not been dismantled. The unemployment rate &lt;a href="https://www.citizen.co.za/news/unemployment-white-citizens-versus-black-youth-south-africa/"&gt;is still about four times higher&lt;/a&gt; for Black residents than it is for white residents; and just 10 percent of South Africans—the majority of them white—own&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/south-africa-economy-apartheid.html"&gt; more than 90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the country’s wealth. Legal apartheid has disappeared, but economic apartheid upheld by loopholes in the law persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the underpinnings of racism and colonialism around the world have not only survived, but been rehabilitated in new and insidious forms. Every year, billions more dollars are transferred &lt;a href="https://newint.org/blog/2017/05/24/how-the-world-keeps-looting-africa"&gt;out of Africa&lt;/a&gt; than are invested in it. Roughly 100 transnational corporations, many of them British, &lt;a href="https://waronwant.org/resources/new-colonialism-britains-scramble-africas-energy-and-mineral-resources"&gt;control $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; worth of Africa’s mineral resources. The mining operations of these companies leave a trail of social and environmental damage and human-rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/long-walk-from-freedom-mandelas-grandchildren-and-a-new-south-africa/262600/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Long walk from freedom: Mandela’s grandchildren and a new South Africa&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern of exploitation extends across the global South. According to a report from the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, since 2015 giant companies engaged in mining, agribusiness, and logging have filed 355&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/morgansimon/2021/07/27/a-lawsuit-a-day-keeps-the-activists-away-new-report-finds-355-lawsuits-filed-by-big-business-against-activists/?sh=3a02766531ec"&gt; largely frivolous&lt;/a&gt; lawsuits that human-rights activists call efforts to “intimidate, bankrupt and silence” those in Latin America and Asia who speak out against such abuses. In Malaysia, for example, European courts are enforcing a $15 billion claim on the developing nation’s own oil and gas reserves, based on a century-old treaty dating from the era of colonial control by the British Crown. Western investors in the lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f4b655d-ef28-446a-8e3c-37090ef138da"&gt;through the litigation-financing firm Therium&lt;/a&gt;, will take the lion’s share of proceeds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the late &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/queen-elizabeth-ii/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Queen Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/19/charles-queen-nelson-mandela-britain"&gt;a great supporter&lt;/a&gt; of my grandfather, and presided over the transformation of the British empire into the voluntary association of the Commonwealth, the Crown’s postcolonial power continues to extend throughout the world. By virtue of its nominal claim to countries such as Canada and Australia, the Crown is by far the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2017/03/land-queen-world-australia"&gt;largest landowner&lt;/a&gt;, with as much as a sixth of the planet’s land area. The Crown is not merely an institution of the British state; it is better understood as one of the world’s &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0038026120916105"&gt;most powerful transnational corporations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/harry-meghan-netflix-attention-apology/672581/?utm_source=feed"&gt;backlash against Meghan Markle&lt;/a&gt; illustrates, undermining the legitimacy of this status quo comes at a price. Harry and Meghan’s alienation from the Royal Family, their questioning of its values, and their challenging of its institutional racism are seen as an unacceptable affront to comfortable assumptions about the West’s achievement of a “postracial” society. By refusing to kowtow, Harry and Meghan became targets for much of the English-language press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandfather’s victory over apartheid does not mean that the fight against colonialism and racism is finished. He would want us to learn from him, to use his example to stand against all of the inequities that persist within the laws and institutions of our fragile democracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my case, my grandfather’s struggle inspired me to launch a foundation—named after my own father, Thembekile Mandela, who died while my grandfather was in prison—that focuses on health, youth, and women’s development in rural villages across South Africa. And that work has in turn inspired countless others to search out the light when surrounded by terrifying darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I count Harry and Meghan among those others, but no one owns Madiba. He is part of the world’s heritage. To defeat today’s injustices, we need his legacy unsullied by vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ndileka Mandela</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ndileka-mandela/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/XtQBiTCHlHbDNc-E7uBbdRsJs1Y=/0x178:2160x1393/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/Joanne_Imperio_The_Atlantic_Benedicte_Kurzen_NOOR_Redux-1/original.jpg"><media:credit>Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic; Benedicte Kurzen / NOOR / Redux</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Others Take Mandela’s Name in Vain, Not Harry and Meghan</title><published>2023-01-19T11:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-19T11:32:59-05:00</updated><summary type="html">I applaud the work the royal couple does inspired by my grandfather.

&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;This article is adapted from Waldinger and Schulz’s &lt;a href="http://The%20Good%20Life:%20Lessons%20from%20the%20World's%20Longest%20Scientific%20Study%20of%20Happiness."&gt;new book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, Bob and Marc, though we work closely together and meet every week by phone or video call, we see each other in person for only a total of about two days (48 hours) every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does this add up for the coming years? Bob is 71 years old. Marc is 60. Let’s be (very) generous and say we will both be around to celebrate Bob’s 100th birthday. At two days a year for 29 years, that’s 58 days that we have left to spend together in our lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-eight out of 10,585 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is assuming a lot of good fortune, and the real number is almost certainly going to be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1938, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/06/what-makes-us-happy/307439/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the Harvard Study of Adult Development&lt;/a&gt; has been investigating what makes people flourish. After starting with 724 participants—boys from disadvantaged and troubled families in Boston, and Harvard undergraduates—the study incorporated the spouses of the original men and, more recently, more than 1,300 descendants of the initial group. Researchers periodically interview participants, ask them to fill out questionnaires, and collect information about their physical health. As the study’s director (Bob) and associate director (Marc), we’ve been able to watch participants fall in and out of relationships, find success and failure at their jobs, become mothers and fathers. It’s the longest in-depth longitudinal study on human life ever done, and it’s brought us to a simple and profound conclusion: Good relationships lead to health and happiness. The trick is that those relationships must be nurtured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/06/what-makes-us-happy/307439/?utm_source=feed"&gt;From the June 2009 issue: What makes us happy?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t always put our relationships first. Consider the fact that the average American in 2018 spent 11 hours every day on solitary activities such as watching television and listening to the radio. Spending 58 days over 29 years with a friend is infinitesimal compared with the 4,851 days that Americans will spend interacting with media during that same time period. Distractions are hard to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about these numbers can help us put our own relationships in perspective. Try figuring out how much time you spend with a good friend or family member. We don’t have to spend every hour with our friends, and some relationships work because they’re exercised sparingly. But nearly all of us have people in our lives whom we’d like to see more. Are you spending time with the people you most care about? Is there a relationship in your life that would benefit both of you if you could spend more time together? Many of these are untapped resources, waiting for us to put them to use. And, enriching these relationships can in turn nourish our minds and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;Y&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;ou don’t have&lt;/span&gt; to examine scientific findings to recognize that relationships affect you physically. All you have to do is notice the invigoration you feel when you believe that someone has really understood you during a good conversation, or the tension and distress you feel after an argument, or how little sleep you get during a period of romantic strife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, having healthy, fulfilling relationships is its own kind of fitness—social fitness—and like physical fitness, it takes work to maintain. Unlike stepping on the scale, taking a quick look in the mirror, or getting readouts for blood pressure and cholesterol, assessing our social fitness requires a bit more sustained self-reflection. It requires stepping back from the crush of modern life, taking stock of our relationships, and being honest with ourselves about where we’re devoting our time and whether we are tending to the connections that help us thrive. Finding the time for this type of reflection can be hard, and sometimes it’s uncomfortable. But it can yield enormous benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our Harvard Study participants have told us that filling out questionnaires every two years and being interviewed regularly have given them a welcome perspective on their life and relationships. We ask them to really think about themselves and the people they love, and that process of self-reflection helps some of them.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/04/happiness-research-how-to-be-happy-advice/629559/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: 10 practical ways to improve happiness&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a practice that could help anyone. Looking in the mirror and thinking honestly about where your life stands is a first step in trying to live a good life. Noticing where you are can help put into relief where you would like to be. Having some reservations about this kind of self-reflection is understandable. Our study participants were not always keen on filling out our questionnaires, or eager to consider the larger picture of their life. Some would skip difficult questions or leave entire pages blank, and some would just not return certain surveys. Some even wrote comments in the margins of their questionnaires about what they thought of our requests. “What kinds of questions are these!?” is a response we received occasionally, often from participants who preferred not to think about difficulties in their life. The experiences of the people who skipped questions or entire questionnaires were also important, though—they were just as crucial in understanding adult development as the experiences of people eager to share. A lot of useful data and gems of experience were buried in the shadowed corners of their lives. We just had to go through a little extra effort to excavate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these people was a man we’ll call Sterling Ainsley. (We are using a pseudonym to protect his confidentiality as a study participant.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Black line drawing illustration of a person inside a bubble of curly cues" height="665" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/img/posts/2023/01/Spot_B_Social_Fitness_Pierre_Buttin/9b82425df.jpg" width="665"&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Pierre Buttin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;terling Ainsley was&lt;/span&gt; a hopeful guy. He graduated from Harvard in the 1940s and then served in World War II. After he left the service, he got a job as a scientist and retired in his 60s. When asked to describe his philosophy for getting through hard times, he said, “You try not to let life get to you. You remember your victories and take a positive attitude.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year was 1986. George Vaillant, the then-director of the study, was on a long interview trek, driving through the Rocky Mountains to visit the study’s participants who lived in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Montana. Sterling had not returned the most recent survey, and there was some catching up to do. He met Vaillant at a hotel to give him a ride to the diner where Sterling wanted to do his scheduled interview. When Vaillant buckled himself into the passenger seat of Sterling’s car, the seat belt left a stripe of dust across his chest. “I was left to wonder,” he wrote, “the last time somebody had used it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling was technically married, but his wife lived far away, and they hadn’t slept in the same room in years. They spoke only every few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/06/six-ways-make-maintain-friends/661232/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The six forces that fuel friendship&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why they had not gotten a divorce, he said, “I wouldn’t want to do that to the children,” even though his kids were grown and had children of their own. Sterling was proud of his kids and beamed when he spoke of them, saying they were the most important thing in his life. But he rarely saw them and seemed to prefer to keep his relationships with them thriving mostly in his imagination. Vaillant noted that Sterling seemed to be using optimism to push away some of his fears and avoid challenges in his life. Putting a positive spin on every matter and then pushing it out of his mind made it possible for him to believe that nothing was wrong, he was fine, he was happy, his kids didn’t need him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t travel to see his son’s new home abroad, because he didn’t “want to be a burden”—even though he’d been learning a new language to prepare for the trip. He had another child who lived closer, but he hadn’t visited in more than a year. He didn’t have a relationship with his grandchildren, and he wasn’t in contact with any friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his older sister, Sterling seemed startled. “My sister?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the sister he had told the study so much about when he was younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling thought about it for a long time, and then told Vaillant that it must have been decades since he last spoke with her. A frightened expression came over his face. “Would she still be living?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling tried not to think about his relationships, and he was even less inclined to talk about them. This is a common experience. We don’t always know why we do things or why we don’t do things, and we may not understand what is holding us at a distance from the people in our life. Taking some time to look in the mirror can help. Sometimes there are needs inside of us that are looking for a voice, a way to get out. They might be things that we have never seen or articulated to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seemed to be the case with Sterling. Asked how he spent his evenings, he said he spent time with an elderly woman who lived in a nearby trailer. Each night he would walk over, and they’d watch TV and talk. Eventually she would fall asleep, and he would help her into bed and wash her dishes and close the shades before walking home. She was the closest thing he had to a confidant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what I’ll do if she dies,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;L&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;oneliness has a&lt;/span&gt; physical effect on the body. It can render people more sensitive to pain, suppress their immune system, diminish brain function, and disrupt sleep, which in turn can make an already lonely person even more tired and irritable. Research has found that, for older adults, loneliness is &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316#s4"&gt;far more dangerous than&lt;/a&gt; obesity. Ongoing loneliness raises a person’s odds of death by &lt;a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&amp;amp;context=facpub"&gt;26 percent&lt;/a&gt; in any given year. A study in the U.K., the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29684289/"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; on the connections between loneliness and poorer health and self-care in young adults. This ongoing study includes more than 2,200 people born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995. When they were 18, the researchers asked them how lonely they were. Those who reported being lonelier had a greater chance of facing mental-health issues, partaking in unsafe physical-health behaviors, and coping with stress in negative ways. Add to this the fact that a tide of loneliness is flooding through modern societies, and we have a serious problem. Recent stats should make us take notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2yzhfv4DvqVp5nZyxBD8G23/who-feels-lonely-the-results-of-the-world-s-largest-loneliness-study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; conducted online that sampled 55,000 respondents from across the world, one out of every three people of all ages reported that they often feel lonely. Among these, the loneliest group were 16-to-24-year-olds, 40 percent of whom reported feeling lonely “often or very often.” In the U.K., the economic cost of this loneliness—because lonely people are less productive and more prone to employment turnover—is estimated at more than £2.5 billion (about $3.1 billion) annually and helped lead to the establishment of a U.K. Ministry of Loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/07/seek-you-american-loneliness-review-kristen-radtke/619578/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Why do we look down on lonely people?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, &lt;a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-03/ipsos_2020trends_march2020.pdf"&gt;32 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults expected to feel lonely most of the time during 2020. In the United States, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30560747/"&gt;a 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that three out of four adults felt moderate to high levels of loneliness. As of this writing, the long-term effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which separated us from one another on a massive scale and left many feeling more isolated than ever, are still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alleviating this epidemic of loneliness is difficult because what makes one person feel lonely might have no effect on someone else. We can’t rely entirely on easily observed indicators such as whether or not one lives alone, because loneliness is a subjective experience. One person might have a significant other and too many friends to count and yet feel lonely, while another person might live alone and have a few close contacts and yet feel very connected. The objective facts of a person’s life are not enough to explain why someone is lonely. Regardless of your race or class or gender, the feeling resides in the difference between the kind of social contact you want and the social contact you actually have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Black line drawing of two people connected by curly line" height="665" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/img/posts/2023/01/Spot_A_Social_Fitness_Pierre_Buttin/825eb1b80.jpg" width="665"&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Pierre Buttin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;I&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;t never hurts&lt;/span&gt;—especially if you’ve been feeling low—to take a minute to reflect on how your relationships are faring and what you wish could be different about them. If you’re the scheduling type, you could make it a regular thing; perhaps every year on New Year’s Day or the morning of your birthday, take a few moments to draw up your current social universe, and consider what you’re receiving, what you’re giving, and where you would like to be in another year. You could keep your chart or relationships assessment in a special place, so you know where to look the next time you want to peek at it to see how things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, doing this reminds us of what’s most important. Repeatedly, when the participants in our study reached old age, they would make a point to say that what they treasured most were their relationships. Sterling Ainsley himself made that point. He loved his older sister deeply—but he lost touch with her. Some of his fondest memories were of his friends—whom he never contacted. There was nothing he cared more about than his children—whom he rarely saw. From the outside it might look like he didn’t care. That was not the case. Sterling was quite emotional in his recounting of his most cherished relationships, and his reluctance to answer certain study questions was clearly connected to the pain that keeping his distance had caused him over the years. Sterling never sat down to really think about how he might conduct his relationships or what he might do to properly care for the people he loved most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling’s life reminds us of the fragility of our connections, and it echoes the lessons of science: Relationships keep us happier and healthier throughout our life spans. We neglect our connections with others at our peril. Investing in our social fitness is possible each day, each week of our lives. Even small investments today in our relationships with others can create long-term ripples of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is adapted from Robert Waldinger and Marc Schulz’s new book,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781982166694"&gt;The Good Life: Lessons From the World’s Longest Scientific Study of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Why I do this, perhaps you ask. I know not, but I feel it happening and I am tortured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can relate. If you’ve ever had mixed feelings about someone you love, you know the intense discomfort that results. If your feelings were purely positive, of course, the relationship would be bliss. Even purely negative feelings would be better, because the course of action would be clear: Say goodbye. But mixed feelings leave you confused about the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romance isn’t the only part of life in which mixed feelings can cause pain. Maybe your ambivalence is instead directed toward your employer, and you can’t decide whether to stay and work to make things better, or go someplace else. Or maybe some of your memories are painfully mixed and hard to interpret. Perhaps your childhood was both good and bad, not fitting into a neat frame, and thus feels impossible to explain to others or even yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixed emotions drain your emotional batteries, like a &lt;a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/troubleshooting/TSG01201462/"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; connecting to multiple networks simultaneously. They are one of the most complex psychological phenomena we are capable of, and bring us a great deal of distress. You might think that purely negative emotions are the most unpleasant ones; in truth, a cocktail of negative and positive can be worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;T&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;he idea of &lt;/span&gt;being able to experience truly “mixed” feelings is quite new. Well into the 20th century, many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886908004480?casa_token=r7ibecx-MVkAAAAA:QbP2qTxSRy_x7W3QJ2O30GW4sCEe_rN4Ce38BU9NyHCY40K3k5xwtj1cgWYQod493Y6qg1PJ"&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt; believed that positive and negative emotions existed on a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051110000839"&gt;continuum&lt;/a&gt;. If you felt “less bad” as time passed after a loss or trauma, that simply meant you felt “more good.” Researchers didn’t think you could feel good and bad at the same time. Even today, people often talk about happiness and unhappiness in this way—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/12/can-i-measure-my-own-happiness/617279/?utm_source=feed"&gt;as if the presence of one means the absence of the other&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, new psychological &lt;a href="https://www.norc.org/PDFs/publications/BradburnN_Struc_Psych_Well_Being.pdf"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; began to collect evidence that positive and negative emotions were in fact separable, and as further research observed, could be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140197119301186"&gt;felt&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously, and also in rapid succession. Neuroscience added support for this hypothesis when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661304001883"&gt;scholars found&lt;/a&gt; that positive and negative emotions largely correspond to activity in different hemispheres of the brain (for many people, negative emotions align with activity on the right, positive on the left).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/06/dont-push-away-your-negative-emotions/613180/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Sit with negative emotions, don’t push them away&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, many emotion researchers &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930600557904"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that mixed emotions happen to just about everyone. Sometimes you feel positively about your romantic relationship in the morning, and negatively in the afternoon, for no clear reason. Or in one moment, you feel good about the overall partnership (I’m glad we’re together!) but bad about certain aspects (she isn’t very affectionate, and that worries me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might assume that your net happiness at a given time would be something like your positive emotion minus your negative emotion; if good &amp;gt; bad, then you are “net happy.” But as Catullus suggests, it’s not so simple: Mixed emotions can impose a psychological toll that’s greater than the result of that equation, because they are confusing and conflictive. You might say that the bad and good are at war internally, exhausting you emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a researcher &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-021-00493-z"&gt;found just this&lt;/a&gt; when he measured the effects of positive, negative, and mixed emotions on well-being: Positive emotions pushed well-being up, and negative emotions pushed it down; meanwhile, the independent measure of mixed emotions also pushed well-being down, and by &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than negative emotions alone. In other words, hating your relationship or your job is emotionally easier than being ambivalent about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;O&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;ne seemingly obvious&lt;/span&gt; solution to the problem of mixed emotions is to try to eradicate them through more binary thinking. For example, you could attempt to eliminate shades of gray in your romance by simply deciding that it is “good” or “bad,” and then acting accordingly. My wife—a Spaniard—has told me that she thinks a lot of Americans do this: Everything has to be either &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;. Psychologists call this “dichotomous thinking,” and studies show that it is neither helpful nor healthy; on the contrary, it is &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-5884.2012.00515.x#:~:text=ranging%20personality%20disorders.-,Dichotomous%20thinking%20is%20an%20individual's%20propensity%20to%20think%20in%20terms,useful%20for%20quick%20decision%2Dmaking."&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with a number of personality disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to think more dichotomously, lean into the zone of mixed emotions, which psychologists call “dialectical thinking.” This is the attitude that opposite emotions are normal and compatible. Some cultures are better than others at dialectical thinking—and my wife is right that Americans tend to be especially weak at it. For example, one 2021 experiment on American and Chinese students asked them to read statements that elicited happy memories and sad emotions at the same time, such as “I have been dreading this moment, but it has finally arrived. A chapter in my life is ending, and the future is still uncertain. I’ll miss the neighborhood and the friends I’ve made. I really do not want to leave. It’s a sad and nostalgic time.” The Americans&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.538793/full"&gt; experienced&lt;/a&gt; almost 50 percent more discomfort when reading this than their Chinese counterparts, possibly because they did not recognize or focus on the fact that missing one’s neighborhood and friends implies that one has happy memories of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/emotional-complexity-study/426672/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The countries where people are the most emotionally complex&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To become more dialectical in your thinking, start by consciously acknowledging your conflicting feelings, as opposed to letting them battle away in your subconscious. If you’re conflicted about your relationship, try writing down its positive and negative aspects. Consider how you might manage the aspects you dislike, or perhaps accept them if you can’t change them. But decide—if the benefits outweigh the costs—that nothing is unnatural or wrong about having positive and negative feelings about someone you love. I have applied this technique in many areas of my life; it provides real relief and raises my happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you are more comfortable with your mixed emotions, start to explore the richness that ambivalence can bring to your understanding of your life. Researchers in 2017&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-04247-001"&gt; showed&lt;/a&gt; that people can find a deeper sense of purpose when contemplating both their happy and sad emotions about a particular occurrence, such as graduating from college. Seeing the true complexity of our relationships and experiences takes us beyond the superficial “great” or “horrible” descriptions that obfuscate more than elucidate our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note here an apparent contradiction: Mixed emotions may bring unhappiness, but they can also bring meaning to life. On reflection, you will notice that there is no inconsistency. Meaning is not only positive; on the contrary, a truly meaningful life is one filled with all types of experiences and emotions, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/06/dont-push-away-your-negative-emotions/613180/?utm_source=feed"&gt;including those we find disagreeable&lt;/a&gt;. This is why some &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/j.2161-1882.2013.00028.x?casa_token=QUYYF08yObUAAAAA%3AFNvMKURD3eXLjtcVxrDwaI-p43oX6r1u2Je2te372-zNuVJWkxAsELOwtvrJsqtSRWjD5gmaQvCef_-E"&gt;psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt; seeks to not only lower emotional pain, but also find deep purpose in it. In a fully examined life, your mixed and negative emotions don’t go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;C&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;atullus’s dilemma&lt;/span&gt; has haunted and inspired us for centuries. In 1989, the Rolling Stones offered a particularly direct reckoning in their song “Mixed Emotions,” which proved to be their last &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; top-10 hit to date. “This coming and going is driving me nuts,” sang the modern-day Catullus, Mick Jagger. “This to-ing and fro-ing is hurting my guts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/12/can-i-measure-my-own-happiness/617279/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Measuring your happiness can help improve it&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is easier when the path forward is clear, of course, but it rarely is. We are built to experience highs and lows, and almost everything truly meaningful has both. Sometimes, that hurts your guts. But that’s the point. Don’t try to make life uncomplicated, or love it any less because it’s messy. Rather, resolve to be fully awake and alive inside that mess.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arthur C.

After all, that is sort of my job as a journalist. Explaining complex ideas in simple terms requires pulling myself out of a pit of ignorance using the rope of other people’s expertise. I can’t do it without begging for a lot of help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for most of my professional life, I labored under a powerful delusion. I thought that asking Smart Questions was of the utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Smart Question is a query designed to advertise the wisdom of the asker. The point may be to establish that the interviewer and interviewee are on equal intellectual footing. Sometimes, the question is designed to get the source to begin the answer with a brief compliment: “That’s a smart question!” or, on a good day, “That’s a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;smart question&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think these kudos were a sign that my investigation was on the right track. I didn’t want to embarrass myself on the phone with a government official or an academic. And a part of me just wanted the conversations to go as pleasantly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after many years of subscribing to the theory of Smart Questions, I’ve decided that I’ve been mostly wrong. Smart Questions are, typically, kind of dumb. And, just as typical, questions that might initially seem dumb or underinformed, or downright unintelligent, are the smartest way to learn stuff if you’re a journalist, an academic, or anybody else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This realization crystallized for me in several stages. A few years back, when I did more editing work at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, I realized that popular articles tended to scope out to see the full landscape of an issue. So, for example, rather than fixate on some lurid statistic about New York City rents, the popular piece would ask a broad question such as “Why are rents so expensive in the U.S.?” or “Why can’t America build enough homes?” We called these queries Big Dumb Questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers seemed to like the Big Dumb Question stories because the articles used the day’s news to investigate a deeper truth about the world. Personally, I liked them because they changed the way I thought about asking questions. Reporting out these BDQs required my writers and me to ask a lot of, well, BDQs. Really revelatory and surprising answers can come from extremely basic questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Can you just explain this to me like I barely know anything about this subject?”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“What, if anything, is actually interesting or new about this story?”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Let’s say everything you say is going to happen really does happen. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; what happens?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most important of all:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Is there some angle here that I’m not even seeing?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these questions assume any knowledge. None of them reveal much intelligence. It’s their openness that I’ve found to be useful. Narrow and specific queries, with a preamble and even some fancy jargon, are still useful here and there, but they’re a bit like fishing for a trout and catching a trout. The most interesting interviews are more like fishing around and reeling in a shark, or a treasure chest, or a drowned aircraft carrier—something you never expected to see on the hook. The best interviews surprise the interviewer, and being surprised is hard if you’re fixated on being smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had thought I’d kicked the Smart Question habit before I started recording my first podcast, several years ago. Producing an edited podcast requires one to listen back to interviews again, and again, and again. In my case, this meant having to listen to hour after hour of my blabbering, try-hard, obsequious nonsense. The experience was egotistically ruinous. I was still asking Smart Questions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In speaking with other journalists about this problem, I’ve learned that smart-question-itis is a malady that afflicts the whole profession. Charles Duhigg, the Pulitzer Prize winner and author of &lt;em&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/em&gt;, got his start as a journalist with the Business section of &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. He, too, thought he knew how to ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would try to show the person that I spoke their language by using business terms and acronyms,” Duhigg told me. He assumed that sources would tell him more stuff if they thought he was smart. “But they did not think I was smart, and all their comments were in ‘business-ese’”—that is, corporate gobbledygook and arcane abbreviations—“which meant many of their answers were totally unusable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duhigg quickly understood how counterproductive feigning intelligence was during the process of trying to collect it. “I realized that my job was not to ask questions that the source knows the answer to but to trick the source into doing my job,” he said. The key was to get them to tell him what questions he ought to be asking: “They know the most interesting things to talk about, and I don’t. So my goal is to ask sort of stupid questions and make them think I’m so dumb so they have to give me advice about how I ought to write this article.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach inverts the conventional understanding of an interview. Most people think the point of a good question is to get a good answer, but maybe that’s wrong. Maybe the point of a good question is to arrive at a better question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Probable Probes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker-vote-ballot/672654/?utm_source=feed"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; (er, 14) initial stumbles, House Republicans have &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/speaker-kevin-mcarthy-vote/672674/?utm_source=feed"&gt;elected a speaker&lt;/a&gt; and handed out committee gavels, and are now poised to deliver on the one promise to voters that they have the unchallenged power to keep: pursuing aggressive investigations of President Joe Biden, his administration, and, yes, even his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flurry of inquiries that Republicans, under the auspices of Congress’s oversight power, plan to launch in the coming days and weeks might well overwhelm the Biden administration, not to mention the public. None of the hearings are likely to command the attention of last year’s Democratic-led January 6 committee, but they have the potential to reveal new information about how the federal government has operated over the past two years and to create political headaches for the president as he prepares to run for reelection. The investigations also carry risks for Republicans, who could lose public support if they appear to be tilting too far at conspiracy theories or pursuing overly partisan—and personal—takedowns of Biden and his son Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a guide to the probes that are likely to make headlines in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Southern Border&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple House committees are planning hearings on an issue that Republicans made, along with tackling inflation, a centerpiece of their national campaign. They’ve accused Biden of willfully neglecting the influx of migrants across the southern border, and although the attacks frequently devolve into immigrant-bashing, the moral and legal conundrum over how to handle asylum seekers is becoming a bigger political liability for the president. Big-city Democratic mayors such as Eric Adams of New York &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/15/nyregion/eric-adams-mexico-border-migrants.html"&gt;are complaining&lt;/a&gt; that they lack the funds to accommodate the migrants who wind up on their streets. A big question is whether the hearings will stay focused on policy or whether they’ll turn into an impeachment drive against Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden’s secretary of homeland security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hunter Biden&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personal and business dealings of the president’s surviving son have been a Republican obsession for years, and now the party has the power to hold hearings on what Representative Elise Stefanik of New York &lt;a href="https://stefanik.house.gov/2023/1/stefanik-slams-joe-biden-promises-house-gop-will-provide-oversight-and-accountability"&gt;has called&lt;/a&gt; “the Biden crime family.” Hunter Biden is already &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/10/06/hunter-biden-tax-gun-charges/"&gt;under investigation&lt;/a&gt; by federal prosecutors in Delaware, and Republicans are intent on demonstrating both that he traded on access to his famous father overseas and that the president was aware of what his son was doing. The younger Biden may be in real legal jeopardy, but the GOP faces a tricky test in making the broader public care about Hunter Biden and keeping its probe focused on his alleged corruption rather than the more sordid personal activities of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/02/politics/hunter-biden-book-memoir-addiction/index.html"&gt;a troubled son&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The “Weaponization of the Federal Government”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To secure the House speakership, Kevin McCarthy agreed to conservative demands to create a select subcommittee modeled on a 1970s Senate panel that investigated abuses by the intelligence community. This one is focused on what Republicans call “the weaponization of the federal government,” and it’s likely to zero in on complaints from Donald Trump–aligned conservatives that the FBI and other federal law-enforcement agencies have unfairly targeted the former president and his supporters. Democrats see a more malicious motive: to undermine and thwart the many ongoing investigations involving Trump and GOP lawmakers, including the special counsel’s inquiry into Trump’s possession of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biden’s Own Classified Documents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans had barely claimed their new House majority when news broke that classified documents had been found at a think tank in Washington, D.C., where Biden had kept an office, and Biden’s residence in Delaware—handing them a fresh line of inquiry against the president. GOP leaders quickly launched a congressional investigation, but they will be competing with the Justice Department, which appointed Special Counsel Robert Hur to look into the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;U.S.-China Relations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats may see the other planned investigations as partisan exercises aimed at tarnishing the president, but not this one. A House vote last week to create a select committee on the “strategic competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party” earned broad bipartisan support, including from all of the top Democratic leaders. The committee is expected to focus on how the U.S. should counter China’s growing economic and military strength, the threat of its possible invasion of Taiwan, and American concerns about its human-rights abuses. Stronger U.S. policy toward China has long been a bipartisan cause in Congress; former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who voted for the bill, is a hawk who angered the Chinese government with her high-profile visit to Taiwan last year. That consensus is likely to add legitimacy to the committee’s work, although some progressives are wary of its potential to generate anti-Asian rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; Is the Band That’s Supposedly Saving Rock and Roll?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By Spencer Kornhaber&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early December, a tchotchke shop in Brooklyn—an employee advises me about which novelty socks to pair with which comical greeting card for a friend. Then her voice, previously curious and chatty, gains a sudden seriousness. She tells me about a concert she went to the night before. The band was Italian, it was saving rock and roll, and it’d play in the city again, that night. I suddenly understood the difference between a salesperson and an evangelist. The woman gave me an order: You &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; go see Måneskin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t go, but I did know who Måneskin was. I first became aware of the group while attending a watch party for the 2021 Eurovision Song Competition. No one at the party could understand why a bar band in burgundy leather, playing what sounded like a Rage Against the Machine song edited for a Chevy ad, ran away with the top prize. Eurovision is known for Abba-style spectacle, silly and bright. Måneskin is all about scowling, and guitars that sound like carburetors. But clearly, the band had sparked passion somewhere—the kind of passion that, it turns out, converts listeners into proselytizers.&lt;/p&gt;

The title, with its focus on a single American city, actually undersells the book’s scope. More than a case study or chronology of a civil-rights movement, &lt;i&gt;Secret City&lt;/i&gt; is a fascinating history of the past century of American politics. It reveals, or reminds, the reader of the supporting and often central role that the scandal of homosexuality—as it was too long understood—played in so many of the nation’s pivotal moments, including the Red Scare of the 1940s and ’50s, the Kennedy assassination, and Watergate. I had no idea, for example, that Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan were all subject at one time or another to rumors that they were gay. Kirchick documents how gay life evolved from subculture to simply culture in Washington over the course of a few decades, and how the nation’s capital was both behind and ahead of the curve in the slow but profound shift in acceptance of gay men and women in public service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Russell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Russell Berman</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/russell-berman/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/c4ecNAW238pmoCecYv_xVeBTxoY=/0x186:8192x4796/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/01/GettyImages_1245611935/original.jpg"><media:credit>Nathan Posner / Anadolu Agency via Getty</media:credit><media:description>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy speaks at a House GOP leadership press conference in December 2022.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">The Coming GOP Inquisition</title><published>2023-01-18T17:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-18T17:30:56-05:00</updated><summary type="html">Biden’s classified documents, the “weaponization of the federal government,” and other new targets for House investigations</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/01/house-gop-investigations-guide/672757/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate"></link></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2023:50-672756</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is an edition of Up for Debate, a newsletter by Conor Friedersdorf.

While its advocates claim that “diversity workshops can foster better intergroup relations, improve the retention of minority employees, close recruitment gaps and so on,” Singal writes, in practice there is “little evidence that many of these initiatives work.” And the type of diversity training “that is currently in vogue—mandatory trainings that blame dominant groups for D.E.I. problems—may well have a net-negative effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a theory about why programs of that sort might fail. After Donald Trump was elected, I studied the political-psychology research on authoritarian personality types. I was especially impressed by the work of Karen Stenner, who found in her scholarship that “a good deal of what we call racial intolerance is not even primarily about race, let alone blacks, let alone African Americans and their purported shortcomings” (though anti-Black, ideological racists do of course exist and African Americans are harmed regardless of what drives intolerance). “Ultimately,” Stenner contended, “much of what we think of as racism, likewise political and moral intolerance, is more helpfully understood as ‘difference-ism,’” defined as “a fundamental and overwhelming desire to establish and defend some collective order of oneness and sameness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I explained in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/what-if-left-was-right-race/595777/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a 2019 article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction isn’t merely about word choice. It has critical implications for fighting and easing both racism and other forms of intolerance. For example, in an entirely separate experiment meant to manipulate the way authoritarians viewed “us” and “them,” subjects were told that NASA had verified the existence of alien life––beings “very different from us in ways we are not yet even able to imagine.” After being told that, the measured racial intolerance of authoritarian subjects decreased by half, a result that suggests a general intolerance of difference that varies with perceptions of otherness, not fixed antagonism against a racial group. Their boundaries (and thus their behavior!) can be swiftly altered, Stenner emphasized, just by this simple cognitive device of creating a “superordinate group”: making “black people look more like ‘us’ than ‘them’ when there are green people afoot.” Under these conditions, the authoritarians didn’t only become kinder to black people, Stenner noted; they also became more merciful to criminals—that is, less inclined to want a crackdown on perceived moral deviance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I went on to explain:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stenner’s book reaches a conclusion that cuts against one of the main progressive strategies for fighting racism in American society: the belief that if we have the will, everyone can be socialized to respect and value difference. “All the available evidence indicates that exposure to difference, talking about difference, and applauding difference … are the surest way to aggravate those who are innately intolerant, and to guarantee the expression of their predispositions in manifestly intolerant attitudes and behaviors,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appearance of sameness matters, and “apparent variance in beliefs, values, and culture seem to be more provocative of intolerant dispositions than racial and ethnic diversity,” so “parading, talking about, and applauding our sameness” seems wise when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put more simply, perhaps 15 percent of humans are psychologically ill-suited to dealing with difference—and when DEI-industry programming deliberately raises the salience of race in a given organization with the intention of urging anti-racism, the effect is to exacerbate differentism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an article that dovetails nicely with Stenner’s insights, Matthew Yglesias once explained why he believes that raising the salience of race in public-policy debates is frequently bad for anti-racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/racism-is-a-big-deal"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep body of scholarship across history, political science, and economics all broadly point toward the conclusion that increasing the salience of race can have harmful results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly frustrating example I came across years ago at Vox is that Rebecca Hetey and Jennifer Eberhardt found in experimental settings that telling people about &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5978551/study-racism-criminal-justice-stop-and-frisk-reform-support"&gt;racial disparities in the criminal justice system&lt;/a&gt; made people less supportive of reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you could react to that by thinking “wow, that sucks, people shouldn’t be so terrible,” but I think most people believe there are tradeoffs between harshness in the criminal justice system and public safety. And while more progressive-minded people would say that’s overstated, there are clearly some margins on which it’s true. So if you tell people a penalty will be applied in a racist way, for many of them, that’s appealing—the system can crack down on dealers and addicts while they personally can rest assured that if their kid happens to be caught doing drugs, he’ll be okay. By the same token, a friend who’s running for office told me that many of the people she speaks to who are most agitated about crime also hate traffic cameras. My guess is that’s precisely because &lt;a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/traffic-enforcement"&gt;traffic cameras don’t engage in racial discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, and nice middle-class white people don’t like the idea of an enforcement system that doesn’t exempt them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the specific case of the cameras, I think we should have more of them and that the aim of our criminal justice system more broadly should be to catch a larger share of offenders in a non-discriminatory way and then punish them less harshly. Ideally, everyone who speeds would get caught and fined and the fines wouldn’t necessarily be very high, but people would stop doing speeding because the odds of detection are overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the general case, I think it’s clear that the goal should be to reduce the salience of race in public debate and focus on the direct objects of reducing poverty, making policing more accountable, improving schools, reducing air pollution, expanding health insurance coverage, and otherwise solving the big problems of American society. All of this would, mechanically, close racial gaps. But highlighting that is genuinely counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mention these writers at such length because many diversity-loving people find it surprising that DEI training could be counterproductive, and Stenner and Yglesias’s work offers plausible explanations for why. But the intersection of politics, psychology, and race is exactly the sort of wildly complicated subject area where epistemic modesty and airing diverse viewpoints is vital for truth-seeking, so I hope that fans of DEI training and members of the industry will stand up for their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to defend the industry in aggregate will require a lot of explaining. As Singal wrote, “Though diversity trainings have been around in one form or another since at least the 1960s, few of them are ever subjected to rigorous evaluation, and those that are mostly appear to have little or no positive long-term effects. The lack of evidence is ‘disappointing,’ wrote Elizabeth Levy Paluck of Princeton and her co-authors in a 2021 &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYW5udWFscmV2aWV3cy5vcmclMkZkb2klMkZwZGYlMkYxMC4xMTQ2JTJGYW5udXJldi1wc3ljaC0wNzE2MjAtMDMwNjE5JTNGdXRtX3NvdXJjZSUzREFjdGl2ZUNhbXBhaWduJTI2dXRtX21lZGl1bSUzRGVtYWlsJTI2dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQlM0RUaGUlMkJNb3N0JTJCSW1wb3J0YW50JTJCVGhpbmclMkJZb3UlMkJSZWFkJTJCVG9kYXklMjZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ24lM0RUaGUlMkJNb3N0JTJCSW1wb3J0YW50JTJCVGhpbmclMkJZb3UlMkJSZWFkJTJCVG9kYXk=&amp;amp;sig=4xen8HeCMLcM8UsmA47K9rRq6rzhemTE1hgTouNCLmHi&amp;amp;iat=1674004230&amp;amp;a=%7C%7C651308815%7C%7C&amp;amp;account=thedispatch%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;amp;email=LVA2fWSNVoh3%2BM%2FAtIU8HrSxGV9TV5jppcQCB7eucKE%3D&amp;amp;s=2b9245950f275059986c18f5aa8b3037&amp;amp;i=371A435A13A11712"&gt;Annual Review of Psychology article,&lt;/a&gt; ‘considering the frequency with which calls for diversity training emerge in the wake of widely publicized instances of discriminatory conduct.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/i&gt; has been publishing articles that cast doubt on the &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail"&gt;efficacy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/does-diversity-training-work-the-way-its-supposed-to"&gt;mainstream&lt;/a&gt; DEI &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/does-diversity-training-work-the-way-its-supposed-to"&gt;approaches&lt;/a&gt; for years. “One reason why I found Jesse’s piece so compelling is that he’s echoing &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ0aGVkaXNwYXRjaC5jb20lMkZuZXdzbGV0dGVyJTJGZnJlbmNocHJlc3MlMkZhbi1haXJpbmctb2YtZ3JpZXZhbmNlcy1hZ2FpbnN0LWRpdmVyc2l0eSUyRiUzRnV0bV9zb3VyY2UlM0RBY3RpdmVDYW1wYWlnbiUyNnV0bV9tZWRpdW0lM0RlbWFpbCUyNnV0bV9jb250ZW50JTNEVGhlJTJCTW9zdCUyQkltcG9ydGFudCUyQlRoaW5nJTJCWW91JTJCUmVhZCUyQlRvZGF5JTI2dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduJTNEVGhlJTJCTW9zdCUyQkltcG9ydGFudCUyQlRoaW5nJTJCWW91JTJCUmVhZCUyQlRvZGF5&amp;amp;sig=5pR8saCDFNQTntJtmqfsqTDgU5cBxfkX7rXiD8YTCvah&amp;amp;iat=1674004230&amp;amp;a=%7C%7C651308815%7C%7C&amp;amp;account=thedispatch%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;amp;email=LVA2fWSNVoh3%2BM%2FAtIU8HrSxGV9TV5jppcQCB7eucKE%3D&amp;amp;s=2b9245950f275059986c18f5aa8b3037&amp;amp;i=371A435A13A11714"&gt;arguments I made more than a year ago&lt;/a&gt;,” David French&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/frenchpress/the-most-important-thing-you-read-today/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;. “I quoted from a &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzY2hvbGFyLmhhcnZhcmQuZWR1JTJGZmlsZXMlMkZkb2JiaW4lMkZmaWxlcyUyRmFuMjAxOC5wZGYlM0Z1dG1fc291cmNlJTNEQWN0aXZlQ2FtcGFpZ24lMjZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtJTNEZW1haWwlMjZ1dG1fY29udGVudCUzRFRoZSUyQk1vc3QlMkJJbXBvcnRhbnQlMkJUaGluZyUyQllvdSUyQlJlYWQlMkJUb2RheSUyNnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbiUzRFRoZSUyQk1vc3QlMkJJbXBvcnRhbnQlMkJUaGluZyUyQllvdSUyQlJlYWQlMkJUb2RheQ==&amp;amp;sig=Bbiy2bvhcK5t82mxm9UwpsSVcq2kbrHPPmC2vetde7u4&amp;amp;iat=1674004230&amp;amp;a=%7C%7C651308815%7C%7C&amp;amp;account=thedispatch%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;amp;email=LVA2fWSNVoh3%2BM%2FAtIU8HrSxGV9TV5jppcQCB7eucKE%3D&amp;amp;s=2b9245950f275059986c18f5aa8b3037&amp;amp;i=371A435A13A11713"&gt;2018 summary of studies&lt;/a&gt; by Harvard University professor Frank Dobbin and and Tel Aviv University professor Alexandra Kalev that said, ‘Hundreds of studies dating back to the 1930s suggest that anti-bias training does not reduce bias, alter behavior or change the workplace.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In French’s telling, that scholarship has implications for the culture wars:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… People just aren’t that malleable. For good and ill, we’re built of sterner, less flexible stuff, and periodic Corporate PowerPoints or group learning sessions can’t really shape peoples’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, for a deep dive into the history of the diversity-training industry, see Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn’s 2002 book &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780742527591"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Race Experts: How Racial Etiquette, Sensitivity Training, and New Age Therapy Hijacked the Civil Rights Revolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s No Planet B”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Aeon&lt;/i&gt;, Arwen E. Nicholson and Raphaëlle D. Haywood &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/we-will-never-be-able-to-live-on-another-planet-heres-why"&gt;reject the possibility&lt;/a&gt; of humanity moving off of Earth:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all our technological advances, it’s tempting to believe we are approaching an age of interplanetary colonisation. But can we really leave Earth and all our worries behind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. All these stories are missing what makes a planet habitable to us. What Earth-like means in astronomy textbooks and what it means to someone considering their survival prospects on a distant world are two vastly different things. We don’t just need a planet roughly the same size and temperature as Earth; we need a planet that spent billions of years evolving with us. We depend completely on the billions of other living organisms that make up Earth’s biosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without them, we cannot survive. Astronomical observations and Earth’s geological record are clear: the only planet that can support us is the one we evolved with. There is no plan B. There is no planet B. Our future is here, and it doesn’t have to mean we’re doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gas Stoves and Asthma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Oster &lt;a href="https://www.parentdata.org/p/gas-stoves-and-asthma"&gt;attempts to evaluate the data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berlin’s Failing Army&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spiegel International &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-bad-news-bundeswehr-an-examination-of-the-truly-dire-state-of-germany-s-military-a-df92eaaf-e3f9-464d-99a3-ef0c27dcc797"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that even with war raging in Ukraine, and the attendant need for German contributions to European security, the German military is in dire shape. It reports the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, the Bundestag passed a 100-billion-euro special fund for the German military, and in December the Budget Committee released the first 13 billion from that fund for eight defense projects, including the new F-35 combat aircraft. “It is clear that we must invest much more in the security of our country in order to protect our freedom and our democracy,” the chancellor said in his February address to the nation. Scholz also formulated his political expectations: “The goal is a powerful, cutting-edge, progressive Bundeswehr that can be relied upon to protect us.” The question is: How much progress has been made on fulfilling that pledge. Since then, after all, the Defense Ministry has been producing little in the way of announcements about restructuring and reform, instead landing on the front pages due to gaffes and catastrophic shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example: The commander of the 10th Tank Division reported to his superiors that during an exercise with 18 Puma infantry fighting vehicles, all 18 of them broke down. It was a worrisome incident given that the ultra-modern weapons systems are a key component of the NATO rapid-reaction force. There is a lack of munitions and equipment—and arms deliveries to Ukraine have only worsened the situation. “The cupboards are almost bare,” said Alfons Mais, inspector general of the German army, at the beginning of the war. André Wüstner, head of the German Bundeswehr Association, seconds him: “We continue to be in free fall.” The situation is so bad that the German military has become a favorite punchline of late-night comedy shows … The German military, to be sure, is no stranger to mockery and ridicule, but it hasn’t been this bad in a long time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is This Morning in America?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Brooks &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/american-optimism-productivity-innovation-rise/672714/?utm_source=feed"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; that the future is brighter for the country than many now imagine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a society is good at unlocking creativity, at nurturing the abilities of its people, then its ills can be surmounted. The economist Tyler Cowen suggests a thought experiment to illustrate this point. Take out a piece of paper. In one column, list all of the major problems this country faces—inequality, political polarization, social distrust, climate change, and so on. In another column, write seven words: “America has more talent than ever before.” Cowen’s point is that column B is more important than column A. Societies don’t decline when they are in the midst of disruption and mess; they decline when they lose energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And creative energy is one thing America has in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provocation of the Week&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Peet’s Coffee &amp;amp; Tea in Davis, California, some workers are trying to unionize. Faith Bennett &lt;a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/01/peets-coffee-union-organizing-starbucks-university-of-california-davis-solidarity"&gt;reports on their grievances&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Jacobin&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other baristas and service workers, Peet’s employees are challenged by schedules that are delivered on short notice, unreliable hours, lean staffing, and difficulty securing coverage. As a result, café positions have high rates of turnover. But members of PWU are invested in making the job more sustainable for themselves and more tenable for those who come next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Davis, Peet’s workers report that they are often scheduled for shifts that are deliberately shortened so that they are not afforded breaks. Meanwhile mobile orders exacerbate understaffing issues: the company does not place restrictions on mobile orders, which often leads to a torrent of tickets, not all of which are picked up, and delays of drinks ordered by customers who arrive in person. The current practice around mobile orders exhausts baristas and contributes to frustration of customers, who sometimes direct that frustration toward staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is possible to turn off the mobile order system, this can only be accomplished if staff from a given store put in a request to the district manager, who oversees operations at approximately seventeen locations. Having this request granted for even an hour is a rare occurrence … mobile orders, a lack of breaks, and understaffing curtail the ability to chat with regulars who look to baristas for social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
